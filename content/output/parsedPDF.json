The aim of the Workshop and the underlying\nProject is to outline a conceptual framework to estimate the benefits of climate change policies, and to help\norganise information on this topic for policy makers.  The Workshop covered both adaptation and\nmitigation policies, and related to different spatial and temporal scales for decision-making.  However,\nparticular emphasis was placed on understanding global benefits at different levels of mitigation -- in other\nwords, on the incremental benefit of going from one level of climate change to another.  Participants were\nalso asked to identify gaps in existing information and to recommend areas for improvement, including\ntopics requiring further policy-related research and testing.  The Workshop brought representatives from\ngovernments together with researchers from a range of disciplines to address these issues.

In other words, as more stringent levels of mitigation are reached, are there increasing\nbenefits in terms of avoided damages from climate change? A few studies have attempted to answer this\nquestion by using a common metric, typically dollars, to express all impacts from climate change. (There\nare other ways to estimate marginal impacts, including identifying unique and vulnerable systems\nthreatened by climate change, examining risk from extreme weather events, and identifying thresholds for\ntriggering state changes in the global climate system, such as shutdown of thermohaline circulation.) While\nstudies that aggregate impacts from climate change in terms of a single metric provide useful insight about\nhow marginal impacts change, especially at higher levels of climate change, there are a number of\nconcerns with such studies. One is that the common metric, particularly if it is dollars, may be difficult to\napply to sectors that involve services that are not traded in markets and can also undervalue impacts in\ndeveloping countries. A second is that it may actually be more useful for policy purposes to express results\nsector by sector, rather than as a single aggregate, and to highlight the distribution of these impacts.\nThis study therefore surveyed the literature on global impacts of climate change in specific\nsectors. It focused on the literature that examined global impacts up to 2100 and to a limited extent\ndelineated some regional impacts as well. It did not attempt to summarize the regional impact literature.\nWe used the metrics as reported in these studies, such as number of people affected, production, and\nprimary productivity, as indicators of global impacts. We used change in global mean temperature (GMT)\nas the primary indicator of climate change, recognising that climate change is far more complex than this.\nFor example, potential changes in regional climate and climate variance associated with a particular change\nin GMT can vary widely and encompass not only changes in temperature but also changes in precipitation\nand other climatic variables. We examined different studies to see if they showed a consistent relationship\nbetween impacts and increases in GMT. In particular, we tried to determine whether damages rise\nmonotonically with increasing GMT, whether there are thresholds below which there are virtually no\nimpacts, or whether there is a parabolic relationship, i.e., positive impacts followed by a reversal in sign.\nThe following categories were examined:\nagriculture\nsea level rise\nwater resources\nhuman health\nterrestrial ecosystems productivity\nforestry\nmarine ecosystems productivity\n***END OF PAGE 6***\n\n***START OF PAGE 7***\nbiodiversity\nenergy.\nAs far as we can discern, there are no published studies investigating global recreation and\ntourism, human amenity values, or migration, although these sectors will most likely experience impacts.\nThe results of our analysis are displayed in Table S-1.\nTable S-1     Summary of sectoral damage relationships with increasing temperature\nSector\nIncreasing adverse\nimpactsa Parabolic Unknown\nAgriculture  X\nCoastal X\nWater   X\nHealth Xb\nTerrestrial ecosystem\nproductivity\nForestry  X?c\nMarine ecosystems X?d\nBiodiversity X\nEnergy   X\nAggregate   X\na. Increasing adverse impacts means there are adverse impacts with small increases in GMT,\nand the adverse impacts increase with higher GMTs. We are unable to determine whether the\nadverse impacts increase linearly or exponentially with GMT.\nb. There is some uncertainty associated with this characterisation, as the results for the studies\nwe examine are inconsistent. On balance, we believe the literature shows increasing damages\nfor this sector\nc. We believe this is parabolic, but with only one study it is difficult to ascertain temperature\nrelationship, so there is uncertainty about this relationship.\nd. This relationship is uncertain because there is only one study on this topic.\nWe found that the studies of coastal resources, marine ecosystems, human health, and\nbiodiversity estimated increasing adverse impacts with higher GMT (although there are inconsistencies in\nthe results for human health and limited data within the marine ecosystems sector). Agriculture, terrestrial\necosystem productivity, and forestry display a parabolic relationship (although the analysis of the forestry\nsector is limited). The current literature is inadequate to enable us to determine then nature of the\nrelationship between GMT and impacts for the water and energy sectors. (There are global studies on\nwater, but given the complexity of this sector, the results are inconclusive.) Finally, aggregate studies do\nnot show a consistent relationship with GMT, so we label them as uncertain.\nThe studies we surveyed show that marginal adverse impacts increase in almost all of the sectors\nbeyond an increase in GMT of 3 to 4°C. Below that range, the studies reach different conclusions. Many\n***END OF PAGE 7***\n\n***START OF PAGE 8***\nshow increasing adverse impacts, some show small impacts, and some show benefits for a few degree\nincrease in GMT, which become adverse impacts by 3 to 4°C. The studies find adverse impacts at a few\ndegrees of warming in several sectors (i.e., biodiversity and coastal resources). In addition, there could be\nadverse impacts for low levels of warming in health and marine productivity. While there may be adverse\nimpacts in certain sectors with low levels of warming, the aggregate impacts below 3 to 4°C are uncertain.\nTaken together, the studies suggest significant variation of impacts at the regional scale. Regional\nresults may differ in magnitude and even sign from global ones. The nature of the relationship between\nchange in temperature and impacts can be quite different at the regional scale. Some regions may\nexperience net adverse aggregate impacts with warming of less than 3 to 4°C. Generally, lower latitude and\ndeveloping countries face more negative effects than higher latitude and developed countries. Even within\ndeveloping countries, there can be some sectors or regions that have benefits, while others have damages.\nThere are exceptions to this pattern, one being biodiversity, where high latitude areas are at substantial risk\nof losing diversity.\nThe finding that global adverse impacts consistently increase beyond 3 to 4°C should be treated\nwith caution for a number of reasons, including the following:\nSome key sectors are not included. As mentioned above, tourism and recreation, amenity\nvalues, and migration are not assessed. Also, we are uncertain about the relationship in some\ncritical sectors such as water and health.\nChange in climate variance is generally not considered. Changes in climate variance and\nextreme events are, for the most part, not considered in the surveyed literature. Increased\nvariance, including increased frequency and intensity of extreme events, could result in\nadverse effects at lower GMTs.\nLong-term impacts of climate change are not considered. The studies do not examine the\nconsequences of climate change beyond 2100. Stabilising concentrations of greenhouse gas\nemissions in the 21st century will still result in further climate change in subsequent\ncenturies, in particular sea level rise. In addition, climate change in the 21st century could\ntrigger important changes in the climate system after 2100, such as slowdown or shutdown of\nthe thermohaline circulation or disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet.\nAdaptation is often considered in a simple and inconsistent manner. We expect human\nadaptation to be complex. Studies of global impacts often make simple assumptions\nconcerning adaptation, either assuming it is limited or assuming it is implemented with\nperfect efficiency. The truth probably lies somewhere between these two extremes. Also,\nbecause the studies quite often rely on different assumptions about adaptation, it is difficult to\ncompare projections in a straightforward manner.\nDevelopment is not examined in a consistent fashion. Development can substantially reduce\nvulnerability of societal sectors (e.g., agriculture, water resources, public health), but it can\nalso increase vulnerability in some ways by increasing exposure. The studies we examined do\nnot make standardised assumptions about development or about socioeconomic change in\ngeneral.\nSectoral interactions. The studies we considered tend to examine sectors in isolation.\nInteractions among sectors, such as changes in water supplies affecting agriculture, are\ngenerally not considered. These sorts of interactions could result in adverse impacts\nappearing at a lower GMTs than might otherwise be predicted.\n***END OF PAGE 8***\n\n***START OF PAGE 9***\nOther important factors such as the effect of proactive adaptations in reducing vulnerability or the\nmagnitude of ancillary benefits (e.g., reductions in pollution from greenhouse gas emission control\nmeasures) were also not considered in this study.\nFinally, if results were converted to a common metric, it is possible that the total impacts would\nbe negative at less than a 3 to 4°C increase in GMT.\nResearch should be devoted to address the lack of coverage of sensitive sectors, the inability to\ncharacterise the relationship between GMT and impacts, and inadequate consideration of key factors that\ncan substantially affect that relationship between GMT and impacts.\n***END OF PAGE 9***\n\n***START OF PAGE 10***\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that the costs of stabilising\ngreenhouse gas concentrations will rise gradually as mitigation efforts move atmospheric concentrations of\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) from 650 ppm to 550 ppm and will rise more sharply as concentrations decrease\nfurther, from 550 ppm to 450 ppm (Metz et al., 2001). An important question is how the marginal benefits,\nor avoided damages, associated with controlling climate vary with particular levels of mitigation. In other\nwords, what are the (presumed) benefits or avoided damages of reducing atmospheric concentrations of\ngreenhouse gases to progressively lower levels?1\nSome studies have attempted to address this question. Smith et al. (2001) identified approximate\nclimate thresholds beyond which globally adverse impacts might emerge, but did not identify how\nmarginal damages or benefits might vary with changing climate. A number of studies have attempted to\nquantify benefits of stabilising climate change (e.g., Fankhauser, 1995; Tol, 2002a; Nordhaus and Boyer,\n2000), typically expressing benefits in terms of a common metric, often dollars. For the most part, they\nsurveyed the literature and used expert judgement to develop algorithms expressing the relationship\nbetween climate change (typically measured in terms of change in global mean temperature) and impacts.\nThe impacts are generally monetized, which allows for direct comparison of the benefits of controlling\nclimate to greenhouse gas emission control costs.\nHowever, one of the chief problems of such an approach is the choice of a common metric.\nWhile dollars may be an appropriate unit for quantifying impacts to market systems such as agriculture or\nforestry, they may not be as appropriate for enumerating impacts to other sectors. In addition, relying on a\nmetric like dollars weighs impacts to those with greater financial resources more than impacts to those with\nfewer financial resources. Other numeraires such as number of people affected or change in land use or\nclassification are common choices, but they also have limitations. For instance, tallying the number of\npeople affected does not account for the degree to which they are affected or the type of risk they might\nface and it can lead to double counting. Nor is it always clear whether winners, those who somehow\nbenefit from climate change, should offset those who stand to lose in aggregation. Similarly, change in\nland use or classification does not measure degree of impact and can allow for double counting as well.\nIn this study, we attempt to identify the marginal benefits associated with different levels of\nclimate change. We do so based on a survey of primarily sectoral studies that have attempted to quantify\nglobal impacts of climate change. Instead of converting impacts to a common metric such as dollars, we\nretain the different metrics reported by the authors. Clearly, this prohibits us from aggregating our results\nacross sectors. Our goal is not to develop a single estimate of global benefits across sectors. Rather, it is to\nexamine the relationships between climate change and impacts in particular sectors and see if general\npatterns emerge.\nIt should be noted that a comprehensive examination of the impacts of climate change, whether\nby sector or in aggregate, is not the only way to identify important marginal impacts of climate change.\nSmith et al. (2001) identified five “reasons for concern.” Aggregate impacts, which are addressed in this\n1.  See Questions 3 and 6 in the IPCC Synthesis Report (Watson and the Core Writing Team, 2001).\n***END OF PAGE 10***\n\n***START OF PAGE 11***\npaper, and distributional impacts, which are addressed to some extent, are two of the “reasons for\nconcern.” The other three are risks to unique and threatened systems (i.e., loss or extensive damage to a\nvaluable system), risks arising from increased extreme weather events, and risks of triggering large-scale\nsingular events such as breakup of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. These last three “reasons for concern” are\nnot addressed in this paper. To our knowledge there are no global impact studies that focus on any of these\nthree.\nThe matter of what index to use to measure levels of climate change is also a challenging one.\nThere is an extensive discussion of this issue in Smith et al. (2001). Ideally, greenhouse gas emissions or\natmospheric concentrations thereof would be the index of choice. This is because the use of either would\nallow a relatively direct comparison of the benefits associated with controlling climate to the costs\nassociated with a particular level of mitigation effort. The problem with these metrics is that there is a\nrange of uncertainty about how climate will change given any rate of emissions or concentration (indeed,\nthere is uncertainty regarding the atmospheric concentration that will develop from a particular emissions\nrate; see Box 19-1 in Smith et al.).\nWe use global mean temperature (GMT) as the index for measuring the global mean climate\nchange associated with impacts detailed in the studies we review. Certainly, for any change in GMT there\nare a range of concomitant changes in global precipitation and other meteorological variables. Global\nprecipitation rises as mean temperature rises because the hydrological cycle is enhanced. A wide range of\npotential regional patterns of climate change are also associated with a particular change in GMT.\nVariation in these regional patterns can have a profound effect on regional impacts and even net global\nimpacts. Thus, one would expect an examination of the type we undertake to yield a wide range of\npotential impacts for any given GMT. We use GMT because it is the most feasible index of climate\nchange, but note its limitations. The analysis is focused primarily on elucidating global impacts. Regional\nimpacts are discussed in only limited fashion, in order to highlight the point that they often differ\nsubstantially from global impacts. This report does not paint a comprehensive picture of impacts at the\nregional level.\nA critical first step of characterising the relationship between climate change and pursuant\nimpacts is determining the general shape of the damage curve, which quantitatively defines this\nrelationship. For instance, do impacts appear with a small amount of warming and increase with higher\nlevels of warming? If so, do the impacts increase linearly (the same increase in impacts for each degree\nwarming) or exponentially (following a concave path, i.e., increasing impacts for each successive degree of\nwarming), or do they stabilise at a particular level (increase asymptotically, i.e., decreasing additional\nimpacts for each successive degree of warming)? Are there thresholds below which there are no impacts\nand beyond which there are impacts? The last relationship would suggest that small levels of climate\nchange might have virtually no important impacts. Or, is the relationship between impacts and climate\nchange parabolic, such that at lower levels of climate change, there might be benefits, beyond some point\nbenefits start to decrease and eventually, at high enough levels of climate change, there are impacts?2\nThese questions are important because their answers determine whether there are benefits associated with\nlower GMT and whether those benefits remain constant, decrease, or increase as GMT rises. Actually\nelucidating this relationship is not always straightforward given the few data points that most studies\nprovide. In these cases, we rely on knowledge of the underlying biophysical relationships to bolster our\nconclusions regarding the shapes of damage curves.\n2.  Linear damages can be expressed as (Y = kX; where Y is damages, X is temperature and k is a constant);\nexponential damages as (Y = kXn; where n is a growth constant); stabilizing damages as (Y = log kX); threshold\ndamages as (Y = 0 if X < N; Y = kX if X > N; where N is a specific temperature); and parabolic damages as (Y =\n-kX + mXn; where m is a constant).\n***END OF PAGE 11***\n\n***START OF PAGE 12***\nThis paper reviews published studies that estimate global impacts of climate change for sensitive\nsectors. The following categories are examined:\nagriculture\nsea level rise\nwater resources\nhuman health\nterrestrial ecosystems productivity\nforestry\nmarine ecosystems productivity\nbiodiversity\nenergy.\nAs far as we can discern, there are no published studies investigating global recreation and\ntourism, although these sectors will most likely experience impacts. Some limited studies on this sector\nsuggest while tourists are responsive to temperatures, they are unlikely to be negatively affected by climate\nchange. Tourists may simply substitute one destination for another or one travel date for another (Lise and\nTol, 2002). However, this should not obscure the fact that local and regional impacts could be substantial.\nWe also examined recent studies that attempt to estimate aggregate impacts (cross sectoral) on a global\nscale.\nWe surveyed the literature to assess whether the published studies are thorough and credible\nenough to enable us to estimate marginal changes in global impacts across the range of likely GMT\nchanges for the 21st century. We also examined the studies in light of the following elements:\nChoice of metric. We report what metric each study uses to measure the impacts of climate\nchange in the particular sector or sectors it addresses. We briefly discuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of the various metrics.\nScenarios of climate change examined. Houghton et al. (2001) concluded that GMT could\nincrease by 1.4 to 5.8°C above 1990 levels by 2100.3 Do studies individually or conjunctively\naddress this wide a range of change in GMT? As we have already suggested, even for a\nspecific change in GMT, there is a wide range of possible changes in regional climates and\nvariance that can substantially affect a study’s results or the interpretation of these results.\nWe also consider whether changes in extreme events or other changes in climate variance are\nanalysed. Rate of climate change is also important, and we assess whether the studies\nconsidered it.\nTime frame. We summarise the time periods considered in each study. Do the studies\ncorrespond to a single point in time or do they cover a period of time in dynamic fashion?\nThe time frame is important for a number of reasons. If baseline socioeconomic changes are\n3.  Even this range published by the IPCC may not represent the potential range of climate change in the 21st\ncentury. IPCC also reports that the range of increase in GMT caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere is\n1.5 to 4.5°C (Cubasch et al., 2001). However, Forest et al. (2002) concluded that the 90% confidence range for\nCO2 doubling is 1.4 to 7.7°C. This implies that the range of possible warming is larger than that reported by IPCC.\n***END OF PAGE 12***\n\n***START OF PAGE 13***\nconsidered, then choice of time frame can affect results. Choice of time frame can also\ndetermine the rapidity of climate change the study considers.\nKey factors. Do the studies appropriately account for key factors that can substantially\ninfluence results, and even reverse the sign of a result? Among the key factors are adaptation,\nsocioeconomic changes (baseline changes), and assumptions concerning biophysical\nprocesses such as carbon dioxide fertilisation of vegetation. Studies that do not consider one\nor more of these factors may have a substantial bias. Studies sometimes assume a greater role\nor influence of these factors than may actually be realised. Some studies may assume a larger\ncarbon dioxide fertilisation effect than may occur in field conditions, while other studies may\nassume more effective adaptation than may actually happen.\nSpatial scale and distribution. We examine what spatial scales are used in the studies.\nAlthough the studies estimate global impacts, almost all of them estimate impacts at a\nregional scale, which are then summed to arrive at global numbers. In many instances,\ncalculation of regional impacts in turn relies on the summation of local results. How\ndisaggregated then are the regional results for any given study? Furthermore, what broad\nbrush regional patterns emerge? In particular, how do results differ by latitude, continent, or\nlevel of development? Typically, discussion of regional results does not address distribution\nof impacts within regions or societies. So, for example, the relative effects on the poor versus\nthe rich are seldom addressed.\nResults. Finally, for each topic, we discuss the results. We are mainly interested in the\nestimates each study derived of the quantitative relationship between climate change and\nimpacts. Do they demonstrate a steady increase or decrease of impacts, are there thresholds,\nor are there reversals in sign, e.g., benefits at low levels of GMT and damages at higher\nlevels? Where there is more than one study for a topic, are the results consistent?\nWe address each topic in turn. The results are summarised in Table 1 as well as in figures\nthroughout the paper. Table 2 presents a comprehensive list of sectors that are likely to be sensitive to\nclimate change, not simply those for which studies exist. It characterises existing studies within these\nsectors according to a number of key factors, and so provides a simple overview of the studies we\nexamined. We also examined the literature on aggregate impacts.\nFinally, the paper discusses the conclusions that can be drawn about impacts on the whole, the\nuncertainties surrounding such conclusions, and several related topics. Finally, we present some\nsuggestions for future research to reduce uncertainties.\n***END OF PAGE 13***\n\n***START OF PAGE 14***\n***END OF PAGE 14***\n\n***START OF PAGE 15***\n***END OF PAGE 15***\n\n***START OF PAGE 16***\n***END OF PAGE 16***\n\n***START OF PAGE 17***\n***END OF PAGE 17***\n\n***START OF PAGE 18***\n2  p\n***END OF PAGE 18***\n\n***START OF PAGE 19***\n***END OF PAGE 19***\n\n***START OF PAGE 20***\n***END OF PAGE 20***\n\n***START OF PAGE 21***\n***END OF PAGE 21***\n\n***START OF PAGE 22***\n***END OF PAGE 22***\n\n***START OF PAGE 23***\n***END OF PAGE 23***\n\n***START OF PAGE 24***\n2. AGRICULTURE\nWe examined four studies that investigated the possible effects of climate change on global\nagricultural production: Darwin et al. (1995), Rosenzweig et al. (1995), Parry et al. (1999), and Fischer et\nal. (2002). Parry et al. (1999) is part of a compendium of coordinated studies devoted to assessing the\nglobal effects of climate change, published as a Special Issue of Global Environmental Change.\nChoice of metric\nThe four studies relied on a variety of indicators to examine climate change impacts on\nagricultural systems: food prices, production of particular crops, changes in potential agricultural land,\noverall production of agricultural commodities, and numbers of people at risk of hunger, among others. We\nfocused primarily on the use of the last two measures, which incorporate the other measures.\nRosenzweig et al. (1995), Parry et al. (1999), and Fischer et al. (2002) generated estimates of the\nnumber of people at risk of hunger (defined as those with an income insufficient to either produce or\nprocure their food requirements). There are several advantages to this sort of metric. First, it recognises\nthat the effects of climate change may affect agricultural production through a variety of channels that are\nnot simply biophysical. Production and the consequent supply of food depend on factors such as demand,\nprice, and the nature of the world’s trade regimes. If ultimately what we are interested in is the ability of\nthe world to feed its population, then it is a sensible numeraire. One additional advantage of this sort of\nmetric is that it allows for cross-sectoral comparison to an extent. Numbers of people at risk of hunger\nbecause of impacts on agricultural systems can be weighed against number of people at risk of coastal\nflooding. However, the social and economic processes on which estimates of number of people at risk of\nhunger depend are complicated processes to model. Attempts to do so rely heavily on assumptions, for\ninstance, about the future world population with respect to size, distribution, income, and level of\ndevelopment or about the degree of trade liberalisation. Results can be sensitive to these assumptions.\nDarwin et al. (1995) and Fischer et al. (2002) also examined changes in the global production of\nagricultural commodities. In both studies, agriculture is considered in the context of a larger picture of land\nuse, and less in isolation than in the Rosenzweig et al. (1995) or Parry et al. (1999) studies. Both are\nconsequently more realistic in the way that they model competition for land between different sectors and\nhow this in turn impacts agriculture. However, while the production process may be depicted more\npersuasively, Darwin et al. said little about the makeup or nature of the future world that must be fed, let\nalone the impacts of climate change on this world. Demand for food will be a major factor affecting the\nlevel of agricultural output.\nScenarios\nFor the purposes of the world food trade model that they use, Rosenzweig et al. (1995) assumed\nthat the climate change associated with CO2 doubling occurs by 2060. GCMs from the Goddard Institute\nfor Space Studies (GISS), the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and the United Kingdom\n***END OF PAGE 24***\n\n***START OF PAGE 25***\nMeteorological Office (UKMO) were used to develop input to the crop yield model, based on a doubling\nof CO2. Table 3 indicates the changes in global average conditions associated with each model.\nTable 3. Temperature and precipitation forecasts for Rosenzweig et al. (1995) general circulation models\nChange in average global conditions\nGCM Temperature (\u0001C) Precipitation (% increase)\nGISS 4.2 11\nGFDL 4.0 8\nUKMO 5.2 15\nGISS-Aa 2.4 Not available\na. Average change in the 2030s of the GISS-A transient run for a scenario of doubled CO2 conditions.\nTo test a climate scenario with lower levels of projected warming, Rosenzweig et al. (1995) used\nthe climate predicted by the Transient Run A of the GISS GCM for the 2030s.\nDarwin et al. (1995) used a similar battery of GCMs, assuming climate changes in accordance\nwith CO2 doubling by 2090. They used an additional GCM, Oregon State University (OSU), which\npredicts a 2.8°C increase in global average temperature and an 8% increase in precipitation. Both\nRosenzweig et al. and Darwin et al. then presented a cross-model comparison at a single point in time\nwhere each model represents a particular change in average global temperature. One difficulty with such\nan approach is that not only can factors such as precipitation be drastically different from model to model,\nbut also regional patterns of temperature may also differ. Nevertheless, this sort of cross-model comparison\nprovides a good first estimate of the effects of global warming.\nThe model system used by Parry et al. (1999) was run for climate conditions predicted by the\nHadley Centre’s GCMs, HadCM2 (all four ensemble members), and HadCM3 (see Table 4). All climate\nchange scenarios were run as transients and based on an IS92a type of forcing (one that assumes\ngreenhouse gas emissions stem from a “business as usual” future in economic and social terms). Results\nare presented at three points in time: the 2020s, the 2050s, and the 2080s. The associated changes in global\naverage conditions are shown in Table 4.\n***END OF PAGE 25***\n\n***START OF PAGE 26***\nTable 4. Temperature, precipitation, and CO2 forecasts for Parry et al.

All climate change scenarios were run as transients and were based on\nA1F1, A1B, A2, B1, and B2 forcing, detailed in the IPCC’s Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. Figure\n1 indicates the global temperature response for each of these models as CO2 concentration increases as\nwell as the concomitant changes in precipitation.\nNone of the four studies attempted to account explicitly for extreme events or changes in\ninterannual climatic variance, which have important effects on present agricultural production and hunger\nrates and might be expected to be at least as important in the future as in the present, if not more so (see\nRosenzweig et al., 2000, for an analysis of change in interannual variance of crop production).\nFurthermore, none of the studies attempted to investigate how agricultural systems might be sensitive to\nthe rate of change of climatic conditions. The Rosenzweig et al. (1995) and Darwin et al. (1995) studies are\nnot dynamic, and so give no indication as to how the pace of climate change might affect agriculture.\nWhile the Parry et al. (1999) examined several time slices, it did not present results for enough points in\ntime or explore a large enough change in temperature to say much about rates of change. The same is true\nof the Fischer et al. (2002) study. In addition, no study in this sector considered the possibility of\nfundamental changes of state in the earth’s climate system and how such an event might affect agriculture.\n***END OF PAGE 26***\n\n***START OF PAGE 27***\nFigure 1. Responses of temperature to increasing CO2 concentrations and correlations between temperature\nincrease and precipitation change\n***END OF PAGE 27***\n\n***START OF PAGE 28***\nModels\nRosenzweig et al. (1995) used a crop yield model linked to a world food trade model. Darwin et\nal. (1995) used a framework that is composed of a geographic information system (GIS) and a computable\ngeneral equilibrium (CGE) economic model. The basic premise is that climate change would affect not\nonly agriculture but also all manner of production possibilities associated with land and water resources\nthroughout the world, including livestock, forestry, mining, and manufacturing, among others. The\nresultant shifts in regional production possibilities would alter patterns of world agricultural output and\ntrade. The GIS links climate with production possibilities in eight regions, while the CGE model\ndetermines how changes in production possibilities affect production, trade, and consumption of 13\nagricultural commodities. The Parry et al. (1999) model system, like Rosenzweig et al. (1995), relies on\ntwo main steps, estimating potential changes in crop yields and estimating world food trade responses. The\nFischer et al. (2002) study takes a somewhat different approach, developing a global spatial data base of\nland resources and associated crop production potentials. Current land resources are characterised\naccording to a number of potential constraints, including climate, soils, landform, and land cover. Potential\noutput is determined for each land class for different varieties of crop. Future output is projected by\nmatching the characteristics and extent of future agricultural land to this inventory. The economic\nimplications of these changes in agro-ecology and the consequences for regional and global food systems\nare explored using a world food trade model, the Basic Linked System.\nKey factors and assumptions\nThe four studies exhibit a considerable range of underlying assumptions regarding biophysical\nprocesses, baseline socioeconomic scenarios, and behavioural and technological evolution or adaptation.\nBefore examining actual results or evaluating the credibility of these results, it is important to consider\nthese key assumptions.\nThe four studies diverge on several important biophysical considerations. Perhaps the most\nimportant of these is whether or not they incorporate a direct effect of CO2 on crop yields.4 Darwin et al.\n(1995) and Fischer et al. (2002) did not model this CO2 fertilisation effect, while the other two studies did.5\nEach study also made somewhat different assumptions about how the world progresses\neconomically and demographically over time. These assumptions are a crucial component of the results\nbecause they represent the baseline against which the impacts of climate change are compared.\nRosenzweig et al. (1995) projected a reference scenario to 2060 that assumes no climate change and no\nmajor changes in the political or economic context of world food trade. It assumed for instance a world\npopulation of 10.6 billion by 2060 (UN medium population estimates), moderate economic growth\n(ranging from 3.0% per year in 1980-2000 to 1.1% per year in 2040-2060), a 50% trade liberalisation in\nagriculture (removal of import restrictions) introduced gradually by 2020, and an evolution in technology\nthat increases global yields by 0.7% annually. Rosenzweig et al. (1995) also developed alternative baseline\n4.  Increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere can affect crop yields indirectly via changes in global climate, or\ndirectly via a physiological impact on crop growth. Increased CO2 concentration is thought to stimulate plant\ngrowth and decrease water requirements, but this effect saturates beyond approximately 700 to 800 ppm (Gitay et\n5.  The reason is that Darwin uses a Ricardian approach (e.g., see Mendelsohn et al., 1994), which assumes that\nproduction systems will migrate across the landscape as climate changes. Production estimates are based on\ntoday’s climate, which makes it difficult to incorporate how changes in such factors as CO2 concentrations will\naffect yield. An advantage of the crop modelling approach used in the Rosenzweig et al. (1995) and Parry et al.\n(1999) studies is that the presumed effect of CO2 fertilisation can be simulated.\n***END OF PAGE 28***\n\n***START OF PAGE 29***\nscenarios of low economic growth, full trade liberalisation, and low population growth, all in the absence\nof climate change. Darwin et al. (1995) used the world economy as it existed in 1990 as a benchmark.\nSince they did not attempt to estimate risk of hunger, but simply agricultural production, this may not be a\nwholly unreasonable decision. Parry et al. (1999) started with the socioeconomic assumptions that are\nshared by all the studies in the Special Issue. These assumptions are consistent with the IS92a emissions\nscenario and are summarised in Table 5.\nTable 5. Socioeconomic baseline assumptions in Parry et al. (1999)\nPopulation (billions) 5.3 8.1 9.8 10.7\nGDP/capita (thousand 1990 $) 3.8 6.8 10.7 17.7\nFurthermore, the reference scenario of the Parry et al. (1999) study, like the Rosenzweig et al.\n(1995) study, included a 50% trade liberalisation introduced gradually by 2020. Technology was projected\nto increase yields over time but at a slightly slower rate than recently experienced (i.e., at about 1% per\nyear). No major changes in the political or economic context of world food trade were hypothesised.\nFischer et al. (2002) explored several different socioeconomic scenarios linked to the scenarios\ntaken from the IPCC’s Special Report on Emissions Scenarios that are used to drive the GCMs. The SRES\nscenarios cover a wide range of the main driving forces of future emissions, from demographic to\ntechnological and economic developments, but exclude policies that would explicitly address climate\nchange.6 Trajectories of population, economic growth, technical progress, and parameters of international\ntrade, among others, are translated to the model of the world food and agriculture system employed by\nFischer et al.\nEach study assumed different degrees of adaptation. Rosenzweig et al. (1995) considered\nscenarios with two different degrees of farm-level adaptation. The first scenario assumes that farmers take\nsteps such as shifting planting dates by month, increasing water applications to crops already under\nirrigation, or changing to currently available crop varieties. The second scenario assumes that farmers\nmight employ larger shifts in planting dates (greater than 1 month), increased applications of fertiliser,\nirrigation systems in fields not previously irrigated, and newly developed crop varieties. One important\nlimitation in this simulation, however, is that neither the availability of water supplies for irrigation nor the\ncosts of adaptation were considered. All the nonreference scenarios also include adjustments in the world\nfood system, which might be considered adaptations of a sort and would influence national and regional\nproduction or prices. Among these adjustments are increased agricultural investment, reallocation of\nagricultural resources according to returns, and reclamation of additional arable land as a response to\nhigher prices.\n6. The A1 world describes a future of rapid economic growth, low population growth, and rapid introduction of new\nand more efficient technology. World population approaches 8.25 billion by 2080 and economic growth averages\n3.3%. The A1F1 and A1B subgroups differ only in their descriptions of the world’s energy sources, and\nparticularly continued reliance on fossil fuels. The A2 world is one of high population growth (14 billion by 2080)\nand less rapid economic development (2.3%). B1 describes a future of rapid change in economic structures and the\nintroduction of clean technologies, where population growth is low (8.25 billion by 2080) but economic growth is\nrelatively rapid (2.9%). In B2, both population growth and economic growth are moderate (10.1 billion by 2080\ncoupled with 2.7% economic growth).\n***END OF PAGE 29***\n\n***START OF PAGE 30***\nThe Darwin et al. (1995) study relied on a fairly comprehensive model of land use that simulates\na number of farm level adaptive responses. With respect to outputs, farmers adopt the mix of crops and\nlivestock best suited to their climatic and economic conditions. If climate change is significant enough to\nalter the classification of their land within the model, they may change outputs altogether. They may also\nadjust their mix of crops and livestock in response to climate induced changes in price. For instance, if the\nprice of maize were to increase, farmers would respond by increasing their cropland and the amount of\nmaize under cultivation relative to other crops. In the Darwin et al. model, farmers can also optimise the\nmix of their primary factor inputs. Land, labour, or capital for instance could be substituted to make up for\na paucity of water. The main strength of the Darwin et al. model is this ability to simulate changes in the\ndistribution and intensity of agriculture within a region in response to climate change, simultaneously\nincluding impacts on crops, livestock, and forestry. Unlike Rosenzweig et al. (1995), the Darwin et al.\nmodel also explicitly simulates water resource markets. However, because it assumes a 1990 economy,\nunlike Rosenzweig et al., current economic distortions in the form of tariffs and subsidies are in place. The\nDarwin et al. model does not incorporate or estimate the costs of adaptations. It is not known if the costs\nwould be prohibitive in some cases or what it will cost for the agriculture system as a whole to make the\nnecessary changes to adapt to the new climate.\nParry et al. (1999), like Rosenzweig et al. (1995), included both farm level adaptations and\neconomic adjustments on a larger scale. Farm level adaptations include shifts in planting date, use of more\nclimatically adapted varieties, and changes in the application of irrigation and fertiliser. Note that these\nadaptations are selected by the analyst. It is not clear what adaptations farmers will actually make.\nEconomic adjustments include increased agricultural investment, reallocation of agricultural resources\naccording to economic returns, and reclamation of additional arable land as a response to higher cereal\nprices. Again, because it relies on the same basic world food trade model as Rosenzweig et al., the Parry et\nal. (1999) approach models the nonagriculture sector poorly.\nThe Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model employed by Fischer et al. (2002) assumes a high level\nof inputs and advanced management techniques at the farm level across the board. For instance, in all\nscenarios, production is based on the use of high-yielding varieties of cultivars, an efficient combination of\nlabour and mechanisation, and optimum applications of nutrients and chemical pest disease and weed\ncontrol.\nSpatial scales and distributional issues\nAll four studies produced and presented results on similar spatial scales. Results were produced\non a regional, or in the case of Rosenzweig et al. (1995) and Fischer et al. (2002), a national level. The risk\nof globally aggregated results informing misleading conclusions is somewhat less with agriculture than\nwith other sectors, and certainly if the metric employed is people at risk of hunger. This is because\nagricultural production constitutes a good that is transferable and is indeed traded globally. If global\nproduction increases, all consumers will benefit because of lower prices. However, on the regional level,\nthere may be important distributional results that are lost via aggregation. For example, impacts on\nproducers are likely to vary considerably. In addition, regions that become food importers are at risk\nshould the distribution system become disrupted. It is fairly safe to assume that for agriculture, irrespective\nof the spatial scale of analysis, risk of hunger will mirror patterns of income and changes in global\nproduction. However, there are few studies in any sector that highlight impacts according to social or\neconomic class at a subnational level.\n***END OF PAGE 30***\n\n***START OF PAGE 31***\nResults\nGlobal results\nThe results of the four studies paint a fairly consistent picture of how agriculture might be\naffected by changes in temperature. The Rosenzweig et al. (1995) results (Figure 2) suggest a steeply\nincreasing trend in adverse impacts, measured as a percentage change in the number of people at risk of\nhunger above about 4°C. The results of the low temperature GISS-A scenario in the Rosenzweig et al.\nstudy suggest that benefits might actually exist at lower temperatures. This GISS-A scenario, unlike the\nother Rosenzweig et al. (1995) scenarios, does not incorporate farm level adaptation. Accordingly, benefits\nat low temperatures might be larger than the Rosenzweig et al. (1995) results indicate. It is also clear from\nthe Figure 2 plot that at each level of temperature change, the more optimistic scenario of adaptation\nreduces adverse impacts. While there is only one low temperature point indicating initial benefits, the\nresults do seem to suggest a parabolic damage curve.\nFigure 2.

(1995) results (Figure 3) are more ambiguous, but do indicate a decrease in\nproduction in nongrain crops above 4°C. Production in total crops may also begin to decrease above this\n4°C threshold. This reduction in total crops is offset by a sharp increase in the production of wheat above\n4°C, driven by increases in wheat production in Canada and the United States.\n***END OF PAGE 31***\n\n***START OF PAGE 32***\nFigure 3. Percentage change in agricultural production as a function of temperature\nWheat\nNongrains\nLivestock\nTotal Crops\nOSU GFDL\nGISS\nUKMO\nSource: Darwin et al., 1995.\nThe results of the Parry et al. (1999) study (Figure 4) indicate adverse impacts at approximately\n1°C, and they sharply increase above approximately 2°C. HadCM2, with higher levels of CO2, seems to\nlead to predictions of lower risk of hunger in the 2050s and 2080s relative to HadCM3. The fact that these\ncurves become steeper over time may well result as much from a larger more vulnerable exposed\npopulation in 2080 as from increases in temperature. Nevertheless, the effect is pronounced. Furthermore,\nthe adverse impacts at about 1°C may be a reflection of growing population coupled with a world economy\nthat from 1990 to 2020 is still plagued by trade barriers and protection. The basic trends, with the specific\nexception of wheat production, remain the same: increasing adverse impacts and increasingly steep impact\ncurves.7\n7. Arnell et al. (2002), in a study that in part provides the basis for Parry et al.’s (2001) “Millions at Risk” article,\npresent results that are quite similar to these. Though the method is nearly identical to that employed by Parry et\nal. (1999), the results rely on a single GCM, as do those for the other sectors that Arnell et al. (2002) and Parry et\nal. (2001) model. Because of the similarity of method and the reliance on a single GCM, we do not discuss either\nstudy in detail here or in the ensuing sections.\n***END OF PAGE 32***\n\n***START OF PAGE 33***\nFigure 4.

(2002) do not present results as a function of global mean temperature. However, by\nexamining temporal results across various scenarios and knowing how temperature changes for the various\nGCMs and forcing scenarios, we are able to deduce such results. Figure 5 shows the increase in the number\nof people at risk of hunger as a function of global mean temperature. Results are shown for two GCMs.\n***END OF PAGE 33***\n\n***START OF PAGE 34***\nFigure 5. Increase in number of people at risk of hunger due to climate change in the 2080s\nTemperature (C)\nCSIRO\nHadCM3\nIt should be noted that because presenting results in this fashion relies on looking across scenarios, neither\nCO2 or precipitation is constant. This may help to explain the downturn in number of people at risk in the\nHadCM3 results. In general, however, both models show that as GMT increases beyond 3°C, the number\nof people at risk of hunger increases steadily. We are unable to determine how temperature and risk are\ncorrelated below 3°C.\nRegional results\nThe regional results presented by Rosenzweig et al. (1995) paint a more complex picture than do\nthe global results alone. Existing disparities in crop production between developed and developing\ncountries were estimated to increase. Under virtually all scenarios of adaptation and climate change, the\ndeveloping world experiences decreases in production of cereal crops, while the developed world\nexperiences increases. Developing regions average 9 to 11% reductions in production. In contrast,\nproduction in developed countries was estimated to increase in all but the UKMO scenario (+11 to -3%).\nThese disparities, coupled with ensuing price increases, translate to increases in the number of people at\nrisk of hunger, most of whom presumably are located in the developing world.\nDarwin et al. (1995) also estimated pronounced variations in regional impacts. In Canada, for\ninstance, the only unambiguously high latitude region, not only does production of wheat increase but so\ndoes that of other grains, nongrains, livestock, and forest products. In southeast Asia, the model’s only\nunambiguously tropical region, production of all these commodities, with the exception of nongrains,\n***END OF PAGE 34***\n\n***START OF PAGE 35***\ndecreases. These results are a reflection of longer and warmer growing seasons at high latitudes and shorter\nand drier growing seasons in the tropics. Impacts in midlatitude regions are mixed.\nThe global results presented by Parry et al. (1999) mask some important regional differences in\nimpacts. For instance, under HadCM2 scenarios, yield increases in high and high midlatitude zones lead to\nproduction increases in these regions. Europe and Canada are clear examples of this trend. However, under\nHadCM3, higher latitudes are predicted to be warmer and drier, and consequently production decreases.\nProduction decreases in lower latitudes under both HadCM2 and HadCM3, part of the reason why negative\nchanges of -3.5 to -16.5% were observed in developing countries. Especially sharp decreases under\nHadCM2 simulations suggest that the developing world may have a difficult time meeting the challenges\nof not only a warmer world but also the more variable one that the HadCM2 ensemble simulates.\nConsequently, the number of people at risk of hunger in the developing regions is estimated to increase,\nparticularly in Africa.\nThe regional results presented in Fischer et al. (2002) emphasise three general findings. The first\nis that when aggregated to the global level, impacts are at most a few percent of global agricultural\nproduction. Changes in the global GDP of agriculture ranged from –1.5% (HadCM3, A1F1) to +2.6%\n(DOE-PCM, A2). The second finding is that agriculture in developed counties as a group will most likely\nbenefit from climate change. This does not of course suggest that no developed countries stand to lose.\nAmong developed regions, North America gains substantially in all simulated scenarios. Increases in cereal\nproduction of 6-9% are indicated. The Former Soviet Union also mostly benefits from climate induced\nchanges in production. Western Europe proves to be a notable exception to this second finding, where the\ntotal extent of potentially good agricultural land systematically decreases, as does the value added by\nagriculture. The extent of good agricultural land decreases in Northern Europe by 1.5% to 9.6%,\nparticularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and by 0.7% to 1.7% in Southern Europe, especially Spain\nand in Eastern Europe by 0.2% to 5.9%. Decreases were also recorded for East Asia and Japan of 0.9% to\n2.5%. Individual countries with decreasing potentially good agricultural land not reflected in regional totals\ninclude New Zealand and Venezuela. The third general finding is that most developing regions, with the\nexception of Latin America, are likely to be confronted with negative impacts. Africa in particular is\nestimated to experience losses of 2% to 9% in aggregated GDP of agriculture. Northern African,\nparticularly Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, as well as Southern Africa and most notably South Africa,\nexperience losses in the extent of potentially good agricultural land, as do Sudan, Mozambique, and\nUganda. Significant negative changes in cereal production occur in Asian developing countries, where\nproduction declines range from 4% to 10%.\nIt is clear then that there is tremendous variation in regional results for agriculture, as will be the case in the\nother sectors that we examine. While it is possible to make generalizations about the nature of regional\nresults, there are always exceptions. While certain regions or countries may experience net benefits or\ndamages on average, a higher resolution analysis suggests that there can be great variation in both the sign\nand magnitude of impacts on subregional or subnational levels. Although we do not belabour this point in\nthe regional results discussions of subsequent sectors, we do reinforce it in Box 1 by briefly examining\nagricultural results for one nation.\n***END OF PAGE 35***\n\n***START OF PAGE 36***\nBox 1. A Snapshot of Regional Scale Results: Agriculture in Tanzania\nAgriculture is the most important sector of Tanzania’s economy. It comprised 45.1% of GDP in 2000 (World\nBank, 2002). Upwards of 80% of the population of the country relies directly on agriculture of one sort or\nanother for a livelihood (Mwandosya et al., 1998). Agricultural production is sensitive to climate change, and\ncountry-level impacts could be quite different from change in average global production. Even within the\ncountry, there is likely to be substantial regional variation in impacts.\nA study conducted by the Centre for Energy, Environment, Science and Technology (CEEST) in Dar es Salaam\nevaluated the risks to agriculture from climate change (Mwandosya et al., 1998). This study relied on the UK89\nmodel (Mitchell et al., 1989) for estimating future temperature and rainfall under a 2xCO2 scenario, where\nequilibrium was assumed to occur near 2075. The results indicate an increase of 2.5°C to 4°C throughout the\ncountry during both winter and summer periods. The pattern of results for rainfall is more complicated, with\nsome parts of the country experiencing increases at times of the year and other parts decreases at certain times.\nEstimates of the effect of climate change on maize yields in Tanzania are available from model runs of the Crop\nEnvironment Resource Synthesis model (CERES-Maize) (Jones and Kiniry, 1986) used by CEEST. The study\nfound that impacts of climate change on three of the country’s most important crops, maize, coffee, and cotton,\nare likely to be quite different. Furthermore, the estimated yields for any given crop could be different\ndepending on the particular location in question within the country. In general, simulation results show lower\nmaize yields, a result of higher temperatures and, in some cases, decreased rainfall. The average yield decrease\nover the entire country was 33%, but the simulations produced decreases as high as 84% in the central regions\nof Dodoma and Tabora. Yields in the northeastern highlands decreased by 22% and in the Lake Victoria region\nby 17%. The southern highland areas of Mbeya and Songea were estimated to have decreases of 10-15%.\nCoffee is particularly sensitive to rainfall, both the amount and the number of days of precipitation.\nAccordingly, coffee production was assumed to depend entirely on rainfall in the CEEST study, which is not\nunreasonable given that most of the temperatures projected the UK89 model fell well within optimal levels for\ncoffee production. In Lyamunugu, for instance, which is an area of bimodal rainfall where precipitation is\npredicted to increase, yields are projected to increase by 18%. For Mbozi, located in a unimodal area where\nprecipitation increases, yields are projected to increase by 16%. In general, coffee yields are predicted to\nincrease throughout Tanzania.\nCEEST’s analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on cotton production in Tanzania parallels that for\ncoffee. Cotton is particularly sensitive to cold temperatures, and is less sensitive to high average temperatures\nprovided water supply is adequate. Temperature changes are not expected to affect yields significantly, because\naverage temperatures would still be within the optimal range for cotton growth. Cotton prefers moderate rain to\nexcessive moisture, and the increases in precipitation projected over much of the country are not expected to be\nexcessive. Consequently, cotton yields would be expected to increase in those locales where precipitation would\nincrease, but would decrease in areas where precipitation is likely to decrease. In general, UK89 projections\nsuggest rainfall might decrease over southern and central parts of the country and increase over the northern\nparts, where much of the country’s cotton is grown. It is possible then, that any cotton production that is\ncompromised because of climate change could simply shift to the north. Overall, production is likely to\nincrease.\nTanzania provides an example of how the picture of regional results can be quite complex and different from\nthat of global results. Depending on the crop in question, regional results might mirror global ones, as with\nmaize, or could well contradict global results, as with coffee and cotton.\n***END OF PAGE 36***\n\n***START OF PAGE 37***\nOther factors\nSeveral final thoughts must be kept in mind with respect to the four agricultural studies we\nexamined. First, while the results we present are generally similar, important realities of food production\nare not simulated by any of these studies. Agricultural production and even more so risk of hunger can be\ndriven as much by political and social forces as by economic or biophysical forces. Famines typically do\nnot happen only because of climate conditions such as drought but often owe their existence to political\nfactors such as war or the deliberate withholding of food from affected populations. These sorts of factors\nare virtually impossible to simulate. Second, the studies we examined point to the need for more\ncomprehensive systems of models that simulate the land use dynamics of Darwin et al. (1995), but coupled\nwith the sort of world food supply model used by Rosenzweig et al. (1995) and Parry et al. (1999). The\nFischer et al. (2002) study is notable for taking such an approach. However, there are important processes\nand phenomena that it too neglects. Ideally, the impacts of climate change on other sectors such as water\nand sea level rise should be included as feedbacks to models of agricultural impacts. Finally, at this point,\nno successful effort has been made to account for the effects of extreme events on agriculture and how\nclimate change might impact such events and consequently modulate impacts.\nMain findings\nOn the whole it is uncertain whether global agriculture experiences benefits, adverse impacts, or\nvirtually no effect for increases in GMT up to approximately 3° to 4°C. The four studies, however, show\nthat beyond this level there are increasing adverse global impacts. These observations are consistent with\nthe broader literature on agriculture, which shows crop yields declining beyond a global mean temperature\nincrease of approximately 3°C. This phenomenon reflects the knowledge that grain crops, which represent\nthe vast majority of crop revenues, have temperature thresholds beyond which yields decline. This\ninevitable decline in yields leads to a commensurate decline in outputs. Farmers can grow crops at higher\nlatitudes and altitudes to maintain production within optimal temperature ranges, but eventually this\ngeographical shifting cannot compensate for higher temperatures. What the four studies show and what is\nconsistent with knowledge about crops is the inevitability of eventual declines in production. What is\nuncertain is where the threshold lies. The studies suggest it lies no higher than 3 to 4°C. However, if\nclimate change results in increased climate variance, greater threat of pests, or less efficient or effective\nadaptation, the threshold could be lower. Conversely, it is possible that future research and development\nwill result in crops with even higher temperature thresholds.\n***END OF PAGE 37***\n\n***START OF PAGE 38***\n3. SEA LEVEL RISE\nWe examined three studies that investigated the effects of rising sea level: Fankhauser (1995),\nNicholls et al. (1999), and Darwin and Tol (2002b). We present results from the first two of these studies.\nThe third study, Darwin and Tol, demonstrates the sensitivity of the results of the former two studies to\nchoice of metric and assumptions about the value of coastal land and highlights important methodological\nissues. Nicholls et al. is part of the Special Issue of Global Environmental Change.\nChoice of metric\nNicholls et al. focused on the effects of sea level rise on people directly affected and adopted\nnumber of people at risk of coastal flooding as their measure. Fankhauser produced estimates of direct cost\nin dollar terms. The direct cost method includes the cost of dryland and wetland loss, the costs of\nprotection, and the loss of fixed capital. However, while direct cost goes further than estimates of number\nof people at risk in detailing possible losses, it fails to capture several potentially important effects. It does\nnot take into account the fact that higher prices would be generated by the relatively large losses of land\nand capital resources from sea level rise. Intuitively, fewer goods and services would be available, and\neach dollar would buy less. Furthermore, sea level rise is apt to impose costs on land-locked areas as well,\nvia higher prices, and thus reducing welfare. In fact, it is likely there could be spillovers due to\ninternational trade. Darwin and Tol developed a method for capturing these sorts of losses with a measure\nof equivalent variation.\nScenarios\nFankhauser presented the direct costs associated with an assumed 1 m sea level rise by 2100. The\nNicholls et al. study used sea level rises of approximately 12 cm, 24 cm, and 40 cm for the 2020s, 2050s,\nand 2080s, respectively. Darwin and Tol assumed a 0.5 m sea level rise by 2100. As neither Fankhauser\nnor Darwin and Tol used GCM input, they assumed that sea level rise occurs linearly.\nNicholls et al. developed a flood model algorithm similar to that employed by Hoozemans et al.\n(1993). This algorithm uses transient output from the HadCM2 (ensemble mean) and HadCM3 GCMs\n(growth in CO2 concentrations from 354 ppmv in 1990 to 731 ppmv in 2080 for HadCM2 and to 642 ppmv\nin 2080 for HadCM3) along with results from an ice melt model to derive global sea level rise scenarios.\nStorm surge flood curves are then raised by relative sea level rise scenarios.\nNicholls et al. did not assume linear rise exogenously, but rather relied on the HadCM2 and\nHadCM3 outputs, both of which suggest a fairly linear change in sea level. This is an important\nconsideration, since the ability to protect coasts or, even more likely, the speed at which wetlands can\nmigrate inland might be exceeded by sea level rise. More consideration needs to be given to this factor.\n***END OF PAGE 38***\n\n***START OF PAGE 39***\nThe Fankhauser and Darwin and Tol studies assumed that adverse impacts associated with sea\nlevel derive from the slow but steady loss of wetlands and drylands, and from the protection costs\nassociated with avoiding some of these losses. They did not, however, account for extreme events, an\nimportant cause of damage that forms the basis of the Nicholls et al. study. However, the Nicholls et al.\nstudy did not consider a change in the level or frequency of storminess, because no such scenarios are\navailable. Instead, Nicholls et al. imposed current levels of storminess on top of expected sea level rise.\nNicholls et al. also assumed a 15 cm per century rate of subsidence in those coastal areas that are known to\nbe so affected.\nNone of the studies considered catastrophic events that might impact sea level suddenly, such as\nthe collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet. To be sure, such an event would take centuries to be fully\nrealised.\nModels\nA key difference in how sea level rise adverse impacts are estimated has to do with what is\nassumed in terms of adaptation. With sea level rise, adaptation typically refers to the decision of whether or\nnot to protect coastal development. Fankhauser and Darwin and Tol assumed an economic paradigm of\noptimal protection, based on benefit-cost analysis, while Nicholls et al. used a more arbitrary approach\nbased on observed practices. The Fankhauser study minimised the discounted sum of three streams of costs\n— protection costs, dryland loss, and wetland loss — for each region it considers. Costs are minimised\nwith respect to the percentage of coasts protected. Central to this effort, Fankhauser also developed an\nexpression for determining the optimal degree of coastal protection, where protection efforts are\nundertaken if the benefits from avoided damage exceed the incremental costs of additional action. One\nadvantage of Fankhauser’s approach is that this trade-off is modelled explicitly, whereas many studies\nassume exogenously given assumptions about levels of protection. What is not clear is whether this models\nactual behaviour.\nNicholls et al. estimated land areas threatened by different probability floods arising from the\nscenarios. These land areas were then converted to people in the hazard zone (the number of people living\nbelow the 1000-year storm surge elevation). Lastly, the standard of protection was used to calculate\naverage annual people flooded (the average annual number of people who experience flooding by storm\nsurge) and people to respond (the average annual number of people who experience flooding by storm\nsurge more than once per year).\nFinally, Darwin and Tol illustrated the limitations of the direct cost method by using a combined,\n12 region, land-use geographic information system and global computable general equilibrium model that\nestimates both direct costs and equivalent variation, the latter to account for second order economic effects.\nKey factors and assumptions\nThe three studies we examined incorporated different assumptions regarding how sea level rise\nproduces adverse impacts, the underlying socioeconomic baselines, and the nature of adaptation,\nparticularly coastal protection.\nFankhauser and Darwin and Tol produced damage estimates that do not depend in a direct way\non population, but simply on the value of land lost from sea level rise and protection costs. Fankhauser\nassumed that these values are constant, while Darwin and Tol assumed that land values increase with\npopulation and economic growth. The Nicholls et al. study depended critically on the evolving population\nand its distribution. Globally, the study used the same population growth scenario as the other Special\n***END OF PAGE 39***\n\n***START OF PAGE 40***\nIssue studies did (see Table 5). Estimates of the average coastal population density in each nation in the\nbase year were borrowed from Hoozemans et al. (1993). It is assumed that the coastal population is\ndistributed uniformly across the coastal zone. Nicholls et al. projected that population densities increase at\ntwice the rate of national growth.\nThe studies did not examine all of the consequences of sea level rise. They did not examine\nchanges in salt water intrusion of aquifers or estuaries, nor did they account for the combined effects of sea\nlevel rise with potentially increased freshwater runoff via enhanced flooding. They also did not consider\nthe effects of potential changes in coastal storms.\nNone of the studies captured all possible autonomous adaptations or adaptations that can increase\nrisk (maladaptations), which for sea level rise could be significant. For instance, migration away from the\ncoastal zone, which would be a likely response in frequently flooded areas, was not modelled explicitly,\nthough people to respond may give some indication of this. Each study, however, built in coastal\nprotection as an adaptive response. Darwin and Tol borrowed their approach from Fankhauser, who\ndeveloped a simple model of optimal coastal protection predicated on a protect or retreat dichotomy.\nNicholls et al. examined two scenarios, one with constant protection (1990) and another with evolving\nstandards of protection, which are assumed to be in phase with increasing GNP per capita, though not\ndeliberately responding to sea level rise. This essentially allows for adaptive capacity to be enhanced at\nhigher income levels. The greater costs of protecting deltaic areas relative to other coastal zones were also\nincorporated into this basic framework.\nSpatial scales and distributional issues\nWhile Fankhauser’s model is general and could be applied in a more geographically broad\nmanner, he provided simulation results only for the OECD countries. Nicholls et al., on the other hand,\npresented regionally and globally aggregated values for results that are calculated on a national level.\nDarwin and Tol’s analysis is based on a regional level. We are interested primarily in global results, but do\nhighlight regional results where warranted. To a certain extent some adverse impacts from sea level rise are\ndistributed via links of international trade and changes in the prices of goods and services. Only Darwin\nand Tol used a method that captured these effects, however. Finally, since none of the studies we examined\nderived benefits associated with sea level rise, globally aggregated results do not run the risk of obscuring\nregional results that differ in sign.\nResults\nGlobal results\nThe results from both Fankhauser (Figure 6) and Nicholls et al. (Figures 7-9) suggest that adverse\nimpacts increase linearly with sea level rise. As Fankhauser pointed out, one might expect protection costs\nto rise nonlinearly with sea level rise, based on the fact that construction costs of sea walls increase with\nrequired height in such a fashion. This might well be the case, but costs of land loss, overwhelmingly\nwetland loss, dominate Fankhauser’s bottom line. Ultimately, were wetland loss the only damage\nassociated with sea level rise, this might suggest a levelling off of adverse impacts, since there is a finite\narea of wetlands to be lost. Fankhauser’s results are sensitive to choice of discount rate and he assumes a\ndiscount rate of rate of zero. One important distributional result, which is not depicted in Figure 6, is that\npoorer nations protect their coasts to a lesser degree. This result has to do not with lack of funds or\ninstitutional failure, but because more protection is not cost-effective.\n***END OF PAGE 40***\n\n***START OF PAGE 41***\nFigure 6.

The results displayed in Figures 7-9 assume protection standards\n***END OF PAGE 42***\n\n***START OF PAGE 43***\nevolve as incomes rise, though not in response to sea level rise. The second two curves, which display the\nresults for additional average annual people flooded and people to respond as a function of sea level,\nexhibit a somewhat steeper increase after a 0.25 m sea level rise, which is assumed to occur by the 2050s.\nIn both cases Nicholls et al. indicated that this is due mainly to the increased frequency of flooding within\nthe existing flood plain as sea level rises. The expansion of the size of the flood plain is a smaller effect.\nThe Darwin and Tol results are essentially a sensitivity analysis, pointing to the dependence of\nimpacts on assumed land endowments and choice of welfare measure. Current estimates of land\nendowment uncertainty led to a 36% difference in the results obtained for global direct costs. By using\nequivalent variation as the welfare measure instead of direct cost, damages are 13% higher on a global\nlevel. Regionally, however, equivalent variation can suggest damages of up to 10% lower than direct cost.\nRegional results\nNicholls found that most of the people flooded in the 2080s are concentrated in the South\nMediterranean, West Africa, East Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. These five regions contain some\n90% of the average annual number of people flooded. By way of contrast, in 1990, these regions contained\n70% of the average annual number of people flooded. The largest populations at risk are located in South\nAsia and Southeast Asia, with its densely populated, low-lying deltaic areas. Africa is also at particular risk\nbecause of its rapidly growing coastal population and lack of means to achieve high standards of coastal\nprotection. Large relative increases in number of people flooded occur in the small islands of the\nCaribbean, Indian, and Pacific oceans. By the 2080s, the average annual number of people flooded\nincreases more than 200 times over the reference scenario.\nMain findings\nIn general, we are highly confident that adverse impacts will increase with sea level rise. The\nstudies we examined are consistent with this conclusion; more land will be inundated as sea level rises,\ndamages from higher storm surges will mount, and costs will increase as coastal defences are raised or\nlengthened to provide necessary additional protection. In addition, there will be other adverse impacts such\nas increased saltwater inclusion. However, it is impossible to determine whether the relationship between\nimpacts and sea level is a straight line or concave.\nThese results point to the potential magnitude of simplifying assumptions that studies of global\nsea level rise make. There is a clear need for methods that do a better job of combining the sorts of costs\nthat each of these studies includes as well as other sources of damage. The value of land, for instance, is an\nimperfect indicator of the true welfare losses to consumers. Nonmarket values ideally should be\nincorporated in a more explicit way. Furthermore, responses such as migration out of the coastal zone\nmight mitigate some adverse impacts while introducing a whole new set of costs. Simplifying assumptions\nabout the characteristics of coastal flood plains need revisiting. The importance of extreme events as a\ndriver of adverse impacts induced by sea level rise should be given more attention, and methods must be\ndeveloped for exploring the potential impact of increased storminess as well as regional changes in\nstorminess. This impact mode could prove to be at least as significant as those that we consider.\nIt should also be noted that sea levels are expected to continue rising for centuries following any\nstabilisation of global mean temperatures. For example, Church et al. (2001) show that sea level would\ncontinue to rise in response to thermal expansion for two to three millennia beyond the time atmospheric\nCO2 concentrations are stabilised at a doubling or quadrupling above preindustrial CO2 levels. Sea level\nwould eventually rise 0.5 to 2 m for a doubling of CO2 and 1 to 4 m for a quadrupling. This estimate does\nnot account for additional contributions from ice melt. Thus adverse impacts over time are likely to\n***END OF PAGE 43***\n\n***START OF PAGE 44***\ncontinue growing. Whether the present value of total damages increases as longer time frames are\nconsidered will be substantially influenced by choice of a discount rate.\n***END OF PAGE 44***\n\n***START OF PAGE 45***\n4. WATER RESOURCES\nWe examined four studies that assessed the potential impacts of climate change on water\nresources: Arnell (1999), which was part of the Special Issue, Vörösmarty et al. (2000), Alcamo et al.\nChoice of metric\nThe Arnell and Vörösmarty et al. studies focused on assessing the impacts of water stress in\ngeneral and accordingly relied on measures of number of people at risk. Alcamo et al. (1997) focuses on\ninvestigating future scenarios of water scarcity, where climate change is seen as a component of this future,\nbut not the driving factor. It too presents results in terms of number of people affected by water scarcity,\namong several other metrics. However, Alcamo et al. (1997) presents the results of climate change on\nwater scarcity for only one point in time. Döll focused on agricultural water requirements, and so\nemployed net irrigation requirements as a metric.\nArnell (1999) produced estimates of the number of people living in countries experiencing water\nstress, as well as estimates of the number of people who live in countries where stress increases less those\nwho live in countries where stress decreases. In this case, a country in a state of water stress is one that is\nusing more than 20% of its available water resources. Vörösmarty et al. adopted a definition and numerical\nscale of water stress from the United Nations (1997), where stress is defined as the ratio of the demand for\nwater, both agricultural and domestic, to the sustainable water supply to which local populations have\naccess. Vörösmarty et al. defined high water stress as the use of 40% or more of resources.\nAlcamo et al. (1997) measure the scarcity of water by means of a criticality index, which\ncombines the criticality ratio (ratio of water use to water availability) and water availability per capita in a\nsingle indicator of water vulnerability. The reasoning behind this is that vulnerability increases as two\nconditions become more critical: (i) total water resources are used up (the critical ratio becomes larger),\nand (ii) the pressure on existing resources increases (water availability per capita declines). Consequently,\nunder this measure, water scarce regions tend to occur not only in arid regions but also in densely\npopulated areas. The criticality index ranges from 1 for water surplus to 4 for scarcity. The chief difficulty\nwith using the sorts of metrics that Arnell, Vörösmarty et al., and Alcamo et al. (1997) do is the\narbitrariness of defining the damage classes (stress versus no stress). There may, for instance, be many\npeople who live just below the stress threshold who are not captured by such a measure. They may suffer\nadverse impacts that are nearly indistinguishable from those who live in an area that is defined as stressed.\nIn addition, water stress is more likely to be a continuous function than a discrete one. As water supplies\nbecome tighter, more and more uses are curtailed and adverse impacts increase.\nScenarios\nArnell used scenarios based on the same HadCM2 and HadCM3 climate change experiments as\nthe other studies that are part of the Special Issue.\n***END OF PAGE 45***\n\n***START OF PAGE 46***\nArnell followed the convention of the other studies that are part of the Special Issue and presents\nresults for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The global temperature and precipitation changes associated with\nthese decades for the HadCM2 and HadCM3 model are given in Table 4. The Vörösmarty et al. study\nadopted a much shorter period of analysis, estimating water stress in only 2025. Both the HadCM2 and\nCGCM1 models predict changes of not much greater than 1°C at 2025. Alcamo et al. investigate three\nscenarios of water use (low, medium, and high) and two scenarios of water availability (two different\nGCMs, see below). Results are presented for two time slices, 2025 and 2075, the latter representing a\ndoubling of CO2 from the reference year, 1995. However the effects of climate change are only presented\nfor 2075. Döll presented results for the 2020s and the 2070s, but not associated temperature changes.\nModels\nArnell used a macro-scale hydrological model to simulate river flows across the globe, and then\ncalculated changes in national water resource availability. These changes were then used with projections\nof future national water resource use to estimate the global effects of climate change on water stress.\nVörösmarty et al. used a water balance model that is forced offline with output from the HadCM2 and\nCGCM1 global climate models. Alcamo et al. (1997) use a global water model, WaterGAP, that computes\nwater use and availability in each of 1,162 watersheds. Some aspects of the models design and data come\nfrom the IMAGE integrated model of global environmental change (Alcamo et al., 1994). WaterGAP takes\ninto account socio-economic factors that lead to domestic, industrial and agricultural water use as well as\nphysical factors that determine supply (runoff and ground water recharge). The study relies on two GCMs\nfor physical and climatic input, ECHAM4-OPYC and GFDL. Döll used a global model of irrigation\nrequirements (GIM), which is based on a global map of irrigated areas that shows the fraction of each cell\nthat was equipped for irrigation in 1995. Net irrigation was computed as a function of climate and crop\ntype, with climatic input generated by two transient climate models, the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model and the\nHadCM3 model, both with IS92a type forcing.\nKey factors and assumptions\nEach of the studies we examined made a number of important assumptions that must be outlined\nbefore we consider their results. As with agriculture, these assumptions can be divided into three classes:\nthose related to biophysical processes, baseline socioeconomic scenarios, and those related to adaptation.\nOne biophysical assumption, which is shared by both Arnell and Vörösmarty et al., is that change in runoff\nis regarded as change in water supply. This is essentially true for Alcamo et al. (1997) as well, though they\ninclude groundwater recharge as part of water supply. However, in practice, not all of this runoff may be\navailable for use, and the proportion that will be available varies significantly across countries. This may\nhave much to do with how concentrated flows are in time and the infrastructure employed to capture and\nstore water for later use. Furthermore, water use is equated with withdrawals from surface water or\ngroundwater in all these studies. Accounting for water use on a purely consumptive basis in this manner\nmay overstate water use. This approach does not account for return flow, for instance, or instream use. The\nArnell study further assumes that people within a nation have equal access to the water resources of that\nnation. Another point is that none of the studies incorporated the effect of increased CO2 or climate change\nexplicitly on projections of water use. This is a particularly important limitation of the Döll study, since it\nfocused on irrigation requirements. For example, inclusion of the CO2 fertilisation in the U.S. National\nAssessment led to a conclusion that demand for irrigation would decrease (NAST, 2000). Agricultural use\nis an important component of future projections of total use, so this is an important omission even in the\nArnell and Vörösmarty et al. studies. Also, none of the studies examined the impacts of flooding or\nchanges in interannual and interseasonal variance in general. Since an increased hydrologic cycle is likely\n***END OF PAGE 46***\n\n***START OF PAGE 47***\nto accompany climate change (Houghton et al., 2001), increased risk of flooding in many parts of the\nworld is also likely.\nBaseline assumptions in these studies are critical. Population is an important component of the\nwater use picture as well since the exposure assessment in both Arnell and Vörösmarty et al. Arnell used\nthe population projections shared by the other studies that make up the Special Issue (Table 5). Alcamo et\nal. (1997) rely on similar projections that are based on the IPCC’s IS92a scenario. Care must be taken in\ncomparing results from the Alcamo et al. and Vörösmarty et al. studies to the Arnell study because of,\namong other issues, their assumptions regarding population. Not only did the studies assume different\ncumulative global populations, but the initial distribution of this population between the various classes of\nwater stress differs as well. Arnell, Vörösmarty et al., and Alcamo et al. (1997) assumed that efficiency in\nagricultural and industrial water use increases. Arnell explored different projections based on different\nrates of economic growth and technological improvements. Initially, the greatest gains in efficiency are\nmade in western countries. Eventually, however, non-OECD domestic and industrial usage is projected to\nconverge to that of the OECD. The Alcamo et al. (1997) study’s assumptions concerning water use are\nshown in Table 6. In their projections, industrial water use dominates total usage in developed countries in\nthe future. In general, industrial use is projected to increase as GDP rises.\nTable 6.

Water use\nefficiency does not\nimprove.\nScenario L = low, scenario M = medium, scenario H = high.\nThe inclusion of adaptation in the studies of water we reviewed is fairly limited. Land use in the\nwater demand projections employed in both Arnell and Vörösmarty et al. was assumed to remain constant.\nSimilarly, Döll assumed that the amount of land under irrigation remains constant. The WaterGAP model\n***END OF PAGE 47***\n\n***START OF PAGE 48***\nused by Alcamo et al. (1997) incorporated land use change. Vörösmarty et al. did allow for migration\nwithin countries to sources of water but on a limited scale. Döll made several concessions to adaptation by\nallowing for changes in the timing of the growing season and cropping patterns.\nSpatial scales and distributional issues\nAggregation of results to a global level poses significant problems in studies of the impacts of\nclimate change on water resources. Most problems stem from lack of data and the choices of indices and\nspatial scales of analysis that available data impose. Assessments of water resources and climate generally\nexamine impacts at the basin level because water resources are typically managed at the basin or sub-basin\nlevel (see Arnell, 1999, and Liu, 2001). Arnell, however, examined water resources results at the national\nlevel. Not only does this not capture basin to basin variation, but small changes in hydrological conditions\ncan also lead to very large changes in the estimated number of people facing water stress. This is the case if\npopulous countries are near the threshold. Furthermore, these national level indices can hide substantial\nwithin-country variation and underestimate the number of individuals living under water stress conditions.\nVörösmarty et al. got around this problem by relying on a grid based approach that uses spatially\ndisaggregated data on water use at the water basin level. The lack of spatially disaggregated data was one\nof the chief hurdles to previous grid based approaches. Vörösmarty et al. detailed a method for\ndisaggregating country level water statistics. Alcamo et al. (1997) calculated water balance on the grid\nlevel (0.5º latitude by 0.5º longitude) but aggregated to the watershed and national level. Döll also\nconducted her analysis at 0.5\u0002 by 0.5\u0002grid level and presented regionally aggregated and basin aggregated\nresults. Because, in general, water is not an internationally transferable good in the way that agricultural\ncommodities are, care must be taken in the analysis of global or even regional results, which can obscure\nimportant adverse regional impacts.\nResults\nSince global results are an aggregation of regional results, we discuss them together.\nThe results from the water studies are far less conclusive than those of other sectors. Figure 10,\nbased on Arnell’s results, indicates the changes in the number of people living in countries experiencing\nwater stress with increasing temperature. There is not much change in water stress by this measure between\nthe 2020s and the 2080s, with the exception of a reduction in the numbers experiencing stress in the 2050s.\nThis reduction is the result of the United States and the United Kingdom moving out of a condition of\nstress. As might be expected, the relatively wetter HadCM2 model predicts fewer people living in water\nstressed conditions. Figure 11, which shows the difference between the total population of countries where\nstress increases and the total population of countries where stress decreases, attempts to give a better sense\nof the total number of winners versus losers with regard to changes in water stress, regardless of arbitrary\nthresholds. The trend is still ambiguous, since one model predicts net loss (HadCM2) and another predicts\nnet gain (HadCM3). Counter to what one might expect, it is the drier model (HadCM3) that predicts a\nlarger population of people in countries where water stress decreases. This is driven mainly by the fact that\nin the HadCM2 scenario, stress increases in the populous countries of India and Pakistan, while in the\nHadCM3 scenario, stress decreases in these countries. In both figures, the results are sensitive to large\ncountries flipping from one situation to another. Regionally, the countries where climate change has the\ngreatest adverse impact on water resource stress are located around the Mediterranean, in the Middle East,\nand in southern Africa. Significantly, these countries are generally least able to cope with changing\nresource pressures. Overall, these results indicate the importance of the regional distribution of\nprecipitation changes to estimates of water resource impacts.\n***END OF PAGE 48***\n\n***START OF PAGE 49***\nFigure 10.

The effects of increased water demand due to population and economic growth eclipse changes\ndue to climate. Here again it is important to note regional changes, which are masked by global aggregates.\nVörösmarty et al. predicted significant water stress for parts of Africa and South America. This is offset by\nestimated decreases due to climate change in Europe and North America. In general, climate change\nproduces a mixture of responses, both positive and negative, that are highly specific to individual regions.\nOf course, there is only a limited amount of climate change by 2025, the date at which the Vörösmarty et\nal. analysis ends.\nAlcamo et al. (1997) present results that highlight the impact of climate change on future water\nscarcity for only one point in time, 2075, and for one of the two GCMs that the study employed. The study\nsuggests that globally, overall annual runoff increases and water scarcity is somewhat less severe under\nclimate change. In a world without climate change, 74% of the world’s population is projected to live in\nwater scarce watersheds by 2075. However, with climate change, this figure is only 69%. These results are\nconsistent with those of Vörösmarty et al., suggesting that climate change is not the most important driver\nof future water scarcity. Growth in water use due to growth in population and economies is the decisive\nfactor. Economic growth and concomitant increase in industrial water demand are particularly important.\nThis is illustrated by projections for Africa, which suggest that despite large increases in population, water\nuse (per capita) does not increase accordingly, because income remains low. Though Alcamo et al. (1997)\nsuggest that climate change may ameliorate water scarcity globally, regionally the picture is quite different.\nSome 25% of the earth’s land area experiences a decrease in runoff in the best guess scenario according to\nAlcamo et al. (1997), and some of this decrease is estimated to occur in countries that are currently facing\nsevere water scarcity. Decreases are estimated to occur in northern Brazil, Chile, Taiwan and the Indian\nwest coast. Countries such as Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, and Morocco, which already experience severe\nscarcity, are projected to have even less runoff. The Alcamo et al. (1997) results also point to the\npossibility that industry will supersede agriculture as the world’s largest user of water.\nDöll’s results mirror those of Vörösmarty et al. When cell specific net irrigation requirements are\nsummed over world regions, increases and decreases of cell values caused by climate change average out.\nIrrigation requirements, however, increase in 11 out of 17 of the world’s regions by the 2020s, but not by\nmore than 10%. By the 2070s, increases occur in 12 of these regions, 10 of which also show an increase in\nthe 2020s. The highest absolute increases were predicted for South Asia, and the highest relative increases\nwere predicted for Southeast Asia, where irrigation requirement per hectare are currently low. Net\nirrigation requirements in Northern Africa and the Middle East were predicted to decrease, even though\ntemperatures increase and precipitation decreases in the major irrigated parts of these regions. This can be\naccounted for by a climate change induced shift of the optimal growing seasons from summer months to\nwinter months, when solar radiation and consequently evapotranspiration are lower.\nOur analysis of the relationship between water resources and climate change is inconclusive.\nAveraging world regions or even countries presents many problems. River basins probably represent a\nbetter unit of analysis. The study that examined impacts on water availability and use at the basin level\nconsidered only a limited magnitude of climate change.\nOther factors\nWater use in the future, with or without climate change, is a complicated issue that is difficult to\nsimulate. Much of the problems that climate change causes in this sector could be amplified or\noverwhelmed by challenges related to infrastructure and associated water services. Potentially large\neconomic costs are likely to be associated with responses or with the consequences of inaction. Where\nwater stress is greatest, costs may also include the curtailment of economic activities, the abandonment of\n***END OF PAGE 50***\n\n***START OF PAGE 51***\ninfrastructure, migration, and, as some scholars have suggested, the possibility of conflict, Vörösmarty et\nal. pointed out. These are difficult costs to begin to capture. Furthermore, the challenge in the future may\nbe as much about how to provide clean supplies of water as it might be about providing adequate quantity.\nMuch of these difficulties may be focused in growing large urban areas, which face major problems related\nto infrastructure, water pollution, and the control of waterborne disease (United Nations, 1997).\nIn addition, it is difficult to assess water impacts at such a large scale. Water resources are\nmanaged at the level of basins, which do not necessarily conform to political boundaries or grid cells.\nImpacts may differ from one basin to the next.\nTo develop a more complete analysis of the future impacts of climate change on water resources,\nit is important to consider a number of factors and systems more thoroughly. These include the climate\nvariance, water engineering, human systems (in particular legal and institutional issues), and adaptation.\nAlso, better socioeconomic data to improve projections of future water use on a spatially disaggregated\nlevel will be important.\nMain findings\nA clear relationship between increasing magnitude of climate change and impacts on water\nresources does not emerge from this analysis. An argument can made that adverse impacts to the water\nresources sector will probably increase with higher magnitudes of climate change.8 This argument is based\non two considerations. One is that water resource infrastructure and management are optimised for current\nclimate. The further future climate diverges from current conditions, the more likely it is that thresholds\nrelated to flood protection or drought tolerance will be exceeded with more frequency and with greater\nmagnitude than they currently are. The second consideration is that more severe floods and droughts are\nexpected to accompany higher magnitudes of climate change. Some regions might benefit from a more\nhydrologically favourable climate, but it seems unlikely that the majority of the world’s population would\nsee improved conditions, especially since systems are optimised for current climate. It might be possible to\nretune systems to changed climate, but the cost and difficulty of doing so would probably only increase as\nthe magnitude and rate of climate change increased.\nOne critical reason why we do not see a clear relationship between increases in GMT and effects\non water resources has to do with changes in precipitation. An increase in global mean temperature would\nincrease global mean precipitation. However, the nature of regional changes in precipitation is quite\nuncertain. Where exactly the additional precipitation falls is not certain. Differences in precipitation\npatterns from one climate model to another are probably more important than differences in mean\ntemperature in terms of their effect on estimates of how water resources will be impacted.\nAn additional reason that some of the analyses do not yield a clear trend is the scale at which they\nwere conducted. The water basin is the critical unit for analysis of water resources. Changes in one part of\na basin, such as increased or decreased runoff, will affect other parts of the basin. Typically, such changes\nhave little effect outside of the basin (unless one basin feeds into another or is connected to another via\n8. Arnell et al. (2002) and Parry et al. (2001) differ in their conclusion concerning water stress. They both present\nresults that suggest steadily increasing numbers of people at risk of water shortage as global mean temperature\nincreases, both for the 2050s and the 2080s. However, Arnell et al. (2002) consider only the numbers of people\nalready living with water stress who would experience an increase in stress due to climate change. This approach\nneglects the those people for whom water stress decreases and in general neglects the impacts, negative or\npositive, on those people who do not currently live in water stressed countries. Essentially, this study considers\nlosers only and provides no sense of net impacts.\n***END OF PAGE 51***\n\n***START OF PAGE 52***\nwater transport infrastructure). Since basins do not conform to national borders, an analysis that is based on\nestimating a uniform change for individual countries may not capture realistic impacts on water resources.\nBeyond this, the impacts on water resources are extremely complicated and can depend on such\nfactors as how water is consumed, the ability to adjust uses, legal and institutional constraints, and the\ncapacity to build or modify infrastructure. These and other factors make it difficult to reach a conclusion\nabout the relationship between climate change and water resource impacts.\n***END OF PAGE 52***\n\n***START OF PAGE 53***\n5. HUMAN HEALTH\nThe effects of climate change on human health could find expression in numerous ways. Some\nhealth impacts would doubtless result from changes in extremes of heat and cold or of floods and droughts.\nOthers might result indirectly from the impacts of climate change on ecological or social systems. The\nformer might include a higher incidence of strokes and cardiovascular disease associated with heat stress as\nwell as potential reductions in cold-related health impacts and increases in water-borne disease\ntransmission. Among the latter could be changes in infectious disease occurrence, increased incidence of\nrespiratory disease related to concentrations of local air pollution, changes in rates of malnutrition, and\nimpacts related to large-scale human migration or economic disruption (McMichael et al., 2001).\nAssessing the impacts of climate change on human health in any comprehensive way is\nextraordinarily difficult. Health impacts are complex and owe their causes to multiple factors. They may\nlead to increases in morbidity and mortality. Vulnerability will differ from one population to another and\nwithin every population over time (McMichael et al.). In general, there is insufficient literature to begin to\nform other than the most rudimentary conclusions concerning overall health impacts. Malaria transmission\nis the only impact category where several studies with good global and temporal coverage exist. The\nimpacts of climate change on vector borne disease are unlikely to be limited to malaria (dengue and\nschistosomiasis are likely possibilities), but malaria might be representative of how climate change may\naffect the risks of vector borne diseases in general. Consequently, we focused on three studies that assessed\nthe possible impacts of climate change on the global transmission of malaria. The studies of malaria we\nexamined are Martin and Lefebvre (1995), Martens et al. (1999), and Tol and Dowlatabadi (2002).\nThere is a growing indication that waterborne diseases may be an extremely significant source of\nclimate change induced health risk. Climate change is likely to lead to increased water stress and\ndeteriorate water quality in some areas, which in turn might well increase the incidence of water borne\ndiseases. Several studies suggest that there is in fact a correlation between average annual temperature and\nthe incidence of diarrhoeal diseases. However, these studies are limited in the range of temperatures they\nexamine or are not yet published. We present the results of one such study, Hijioka et al. (2002), in\nabbreviated fashion. We also briefly examined Tol’s (1999 a and b) results of how mortality is influenced\ndirectly by changes in temperature, both high and low.\nChoice of metric\nBoth Martens et al. and Martin and Lefebvre characterised the risk of increased malaria\ntransmission. Martens et al. estimated changes in the number of people at risk of malaria infection, while\nMartin and Lefebvre estimated changes in the area of potential transmission. Tol and Dowlatabadi\nprovided estimates of the increase in mortality, but these estimates are based on those of other studies,\nwhich only go so far in estimating malaria potential.\n***END OF PAGE 53***\n\n***START OF PAGE 54***\nScenarios\nMartens et al. relied on the transient scenarios that are shared by the other Special Issue studies\n(see Table 4 for associated temperature and precipitation anomalies). Martin and Lefebvre assessed the\nimpacts of a doubling of CO2, though they did not state their assumptions about when equilibrium is\nachieved. They used climatic output from the following set of GCMs: GISS, GFDL, UKMO, and OSU\n(see Table 3). Tol and Dowlatabadi’s period of analysis ends in 2100. The climate change simulations in\nTol and Dowlatabadi are endogenous, based on scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions that are tied to\neconomic activity.\nModels\nThe relationship between climate and human health is complex (Balbus and Wilson, 2000). A\nnumber of factors, ranging from the ecology of disease vectors to how access to public health services is\ndetermined by level or income or development, must be understood well to make reliable predictions of the\neffect of climate change on malaria mortality and morbidity.\nMartin and Lefebvre used a model of malaria that predicts potential transmission, which occurs\nwhen environmental conditions are favourable at the same time and same place to both malaria parasites\nand malaria vectors. The model also makes prediction based on endemicity, where seasonal transmission\noccurs when the conditions are favourable for 7 or fewer months of a year; perennial transmission occurs\nwhen the favourable conditions exist for 8 months per year or more.\nThe Martens et al. study is based on a model of malaria that is part of the MIASMA model. This\nmodel is more sophisticated than that of Martin and Lefebvre in that it includes estimates regarding the\ndistribution of 18 different malaria vectors, species-specific relationships between temperature and\ntransmission dynamics, and a more realistic approach regarding malaria endemicity (epidemics versus\nyear-round transmission).\nTol and Dowlatabadi relied on the integrated model FUND (Tol, 1997) and developed a simple\nmodel of vector borne disease, which is parameterised from the results of studies of malaria potential. They\nrelied on three other studies of climate change and malaria to parameterise their meta-model. An increase\nin potential is assumed to create an analogous increase in incidence.\nKey factors and assumptions\nMartin and Lefebvre’s model is the simplest of those we consider. It does not consider the\nepidemiology of malaria transmission or human interaction of any kind. Predictions of malaria potential\nare based entirely on the coincidence of the proper climatic conditions in the same location necessary to\nensure the theoretical survival of vector and parasite. The model does not account for adaptation, land use\nchange, control efforts, biogeographical change, or extreme events. Nor does it take into account potential\nbarriers to vector migration, physical or ecological.\nMartens et al. employed an approach that is somewhat more sophisticated. While it incorporates\nsignificant epidemiological insight such as survival of vectors as a function of daily temperature, mosquito\nspecies distribution is assumed to be unchanged by climate. Changes in potential transmission are based\nentirely on climate driven impacts on parasite life cycle, vector survival and longevity, and vector-human\ninteraction. This model also does not allow for land use change or control efforts. Tol and Dowlatabadi\ntransformed the results from several studies predicting risk of malaria transmission to actual mortality.\n***END OF PAGE 54***\n\n***START OF PAGE 55***\nThey did this by assuming that the current regional death tolls from malaria increase as the risk of potential\ntransmission increases with temperature.\nAll three studies attempted to account for baseline socioeconomic changes. Martin and Lefebvre\ncompared their results to a World Health Organization (WHO) map or malaria distribution for 1992.\nMartens et al. used a gridded data base of population distribution and linked it via a relational database to\nWorld Bank midrange projections of population shared by the other Special Issue studies. Future\npopulation distributions are estimated for the three time slices that correspond to the analysis, the 2020s,\n2050s, and 2080s. Tol and Dowlatabadi’s scenarios of demographic and economic change are based on\nthose of the Energy Modeling Forum’s Standardised Scenario. They assumed that population changes\nwithin a region are homogenous.\nNeither the Martens et al. study nor the Martin and Lefebvre study incorporated adaptation of any\nkind. This is a significant limitation because the strength of the public health system is a critical factor\ndetermining risk to infectious disease (Patz et al., 2000). Tol and Dowlatabadi explored the importance of\naccess to public health services on malaria mortality by assuming a linear relationship between access to\npublic health services and regional per capita income. They then developed a simple model for relating\nincome, temperature, and vector borne disease mortality. Scenarios of mortality with and without a\nbaseline of economic growth were then considered.\nSpatial scales and distributional issues\nThe estimates of change in population at risk of malaria in Martens et al. are presented by region,\nthough the model is structured on a grid cell scale. It should be noted that the MIASMA model on which\nthis study relied has not been validated at a global level because of the uncertainty regarding the natural\nlimits of malaria distribution, which stems from a lack of historical records describing the presence of\nmalaria, and also the instability of malaria transmission at the fringes of this zone, where only infrequent\ntransmission occurs. It has, however, been validated successfully at country and regional levels. Results\npresented on a global basis represent the aggregation of regional results. The Malaria Potential Occurrence\nZone model that Martin and Lefebvre used operates with grid squares of 0.5° latitude by 0.5° longitude.\nResults are presented on the grid level cartographically and as global aggregates. The FUND model that\nTol and Dowlatabadi used is specified with different geographical resolutions for socioeconomic and\nphysical aspects of their simulations. The atmospheric physics and climate change simulations of FUND\nare simulated globally. The socioeconomic components are aggregated into nine major world regions.\nResults\nGlobal results\nThe studies tend to portray an increase in health risks with increasing temperature. Martin and\nLefebvre (Figure 12) suggested that a global increase of seasonal potential malaria transmission zones is\ncaused by the encroachment of seasonal zones on perennial ones and by the expansion of seasonal malaria\ninto areas formerly free of malaria. The increase in area of potential transmission in all malarious zones\nseems to be linear and increasing with temperature.\n***END OF PAGE 55***\n\n***START OF PAGE 56***\nFigure 12. Percentage change in extent of potential malaria transmission as a function of temperature\nSeasonal\nPerennial\nAll malarious zones\nOSU GFDL GISS UKMO\nSource: Martin and Lefebvre, 1995\nThe results from Martens et al. are shown in Figures 13 and 14. Figure 13 depicts the additional\npeople at risk for falciparum malaria and Figure 14 depicts additional people at risk for vivax malaria, for\nboth the HadCM2 and HadCM3 models. Year-round transmission appears to increase linearly with\ntemperature for both types. However, the risk of epidemics is reduced and in both cases decreases\ngradually with temperature. It is more difficult to draw conclusions about seasonal transmission, though in\nthe case of falciparum, at least, risk also seems to decrease with rising temperature. In both cases, these\nmeasures risk missing potential increases in the actual disease burden. The portion of the year during\nwhich transmission can occur might increase, but if the increase is not enough to trigger a change in risk\ncategory, as defined in the study, this increase will not register. The results could, however, indicate an\nexpansion of year-round transmission at the expense of seasonal and epidemic transmission, coupled with\nan expansion at the fringes of malarious zones, mostly likely in the form of epidemic transmission\npotential.\n***END OF PAGE 56***\n\n***START OF PAGE 57***\nFigure 13.

In fact, the reverse could well be true in many locations. Populations\nexposed to malaria year-round often develop a higher immunity than do those exposed less frequently.\nArguably, one could simply sum the number of people at risk for malaria, regardless of endemicity or\nvariety of parasite. Though this clearly mixes types of risk, it would provide some crude indication of how\nthe total number of people exposed to malaria might change with climate. Doing this in Figure 13 or Figure\n14 would yield an increasing trend, suggesting that the number of people at risk of malaria over the next\ncentury does increase. This could be the case. However, given that different sorts of malaria risk are likely\nto have different implications for actual mortality and the pitfalls in interpretation that result from\naggregation, we do not do so.\nTol and Dowlatabadi took the approach of converting risk of potential transmission to mortality,\nwhich allows for aggregation across different endemicities smoothly. However, Tol and Dowlatabadi\nprovided results of mortality as a function of only time and not temperature. They did, though, show that\nby the last decade of the century, global mortality from malaria is reduced to virtually zero as a result of\neconomic growth and presumably better access to public health services.\nRegional results\nSeveral regional results are worth noting. The number of people at risk of seasonal transmission\nincreases strongly in Africa. This is due primarily, according to Martens et al., to some regions becoming\ntoo dry and consequently moving from year-round transmission to seasonal transmission. For example, a\nsimilar change occurs in Southern Africa, where risk of seasonal transmission changes to risk of epidemics\nbecause of a decrease in precipitation. Additional numbers of people at risk increase most in regions where\nclimate is currently unsuitable for the parasite to thrive, but the vector is nonetheless present. In the Eastern\nMediterranean, climate change is predicted to transform current no risk areas into areas of potential\ntransmission risk. Conversely, in Central America, malaria transmission zones are already limited by\nvector distribution, and consequently, the model does not predict increases in number of people at risk here\n(vector distribution is assumed to be constant).\nOther factors\nIt is important to point out the inadequacy of both malaria potential as a risk indicator and\nexisting attempts to convert this to risk potential to actual mortality. The biggest problem with the first\napproach is that it does not account for public health measures to control malaria. For example, much of\nthe United States is a potential malaria transmission zone, but the risks are low because of public health\nmeasures (Patz et al., 2000). An additional problem is that in regions that are already saturated with\n9.  Arnell et al. (2002) and Parry et al. (2001) present results for additional millions of people at risk of malaria, for\nboth the 2050s and the 2080s, that suggest a steadily increasing trend between temperature increases of 0° and\n3°C. These studies rely on a method and socioeconomic assumptions that are quite similar to those of Martens et\nal. Both studies look at the total additional population living in an area where the potential for malaria\ntransmission exists. The two studies differ from Martens et al. only in how they aggregate results. Results are\naggregated across different types of risk, as defined by seasonality of transmission. Total aggregate results include\nthe populations of all areas that experience an increase in potential transmission and where the duration of the\ntransmission season is at least one month per year. Furthermore, results are presented for only one malaria\nparasite, falciparum, and much of the increase that is indicated is for what is most likely epidemic transmission in\ndeveloped countries, where public health infrastructure makes it unlikely that such a risk would be realized as a\nsignificant disease burden.\n***END OF PAGE 58***\n\n***START OF PAGE 59***\nmalaria, an increase in potential would not be likely to result in an increase in incidence. In those regions\nthat are free of malaria, a small increase in potential transmission could have serious effects on incidence.\nFurthermore, despite the obvious difficulties of converting risk potential to mortality, doing so does not\ncapture morbidity, potentially an even more important cost globally. In addition, humans are capable of\ndeveloping partial immunity when exposed to malaria infections regularly. Consequently, it is possible that\nthe burden of disease is actually lower in an area with year-round transmission than in an area\ncharacterised by seasonal transmission.\nFinally, any comprehensive effort to assess the potential impacts of climate change on human\nhealth must be much broader in scope than an analysis of one vector borne disease. The potential exists for\nclimate change to affect human health via a number of avenues. Both vectors and the infectious diseases\nthey bear are likely to be affected by changes in temperature and precipitation. In the following section, we\ntouch on the possibility that climate change could influence health directly, by its impact on temperature\nextremes, both high and low. However, climate change could also affect the proliferation of infectious\ndiseases not borne by vectors. Extreme events such as heat waves or floods are accompanied by the\npossibility of mortality or morbidity. Finally, human health might be affected indirectly by the effects of\nclimate change on agriculture (malnutrition) or water resources. There is little if any attention devoted to\nthese other avenues in the literature.\nWater borne disease\nHijioka et al. (2002) developed a statistical model to explain the current incidence of diarrhoeal\ndisease in 13 world regions. The model relies on two explanatory variables, water supply coverage and\nannual average temperature. The increase in diarrhoeal incidence, expressed as incidence per capita per\nyear, is approximately 7.3% for a temperature increase of 1°C. This figure is similar to what previous\nresearch has estimated (e.g., Checkley et al., 2000) This model is then coupled with a second that estimates\nfuture scenarios of water supply coverage as a function of income, to produce an equation for the\nestimation of diarrhoeal incidence as a function of temperature change. This equation simultaneously\naccounts for the reduction in water borne diarrhoeal incidence resulting from improvements in the water\nsupply coverage and related sanitary conditions in developing countries (due to increasing income) and for\nthe increase in diarrhoeal incidence resulting from the proliferation of pathogens and promotion of\nputrefaction due to increased temperatures in both developing countries and developed countries.\nHijioka et al. investigated the results for four scenarios of emissions, temperature change, and\nsocioeconomic development. These are the A1B, A2, B1 and B2 scenarios from the Special Report on\nEmission Scenarios. They use a simplified climate model to produce global temperature changes based on\nthe emissions associated with each of these scenarios, the results of which are then scaled to the 13 regions\nbased on the future climate spatial distribution generated by the NIES/CCSR GCM (IS92a forcing).10\nFuture scenarios of water supply coverage are developed based on a second statistical model that relies on\neconomic growth (per capita GDP) as the independent variable. Rates of economic growth are specified in\nthe SRES scenarios.\n10.  Scaling GCM output based on the IS92a scenario to reflect SRES scenarios does raise a concern, particularly at\nthe regional scale. The IS92a scenario assumes relatively high emissions of sulfate aerosols, which can have a\nstrong cooling effect. This can result in some regions being much cooler than they are in lower aerosol emissions\nscenarios. Scaling assumes that the magnitude changes in proportion with global mean temperature. Under the\nSRES scenarios, we could reasonably expect a projection of higher temperatures in many regions relative to the\nIS92a scenario.\n***END OF PAGE 59***\n\n***START OF PAGE 60***\nHijioka et al. used statistical methods, and the underlying assumption is that the relationship\nbetween the dependent variable, diarrhoeal incidence in this case, and the independent variables, water\nsupply coverage and temperature, will remain fundamentally the same in the future. This may or may not\nbe the case. Given its simplicity, this approach does not incorporate adaptation in any explicit fashion nor\ndoes it consider how climate change might affect water supply coverage. The model also makes no attempt\nto incorporate knowledge about the epidemiology of water borne disease.\nHijioka et al. present global results for two time slices, 2025 and 2055, for each of the four\nscenarios. This means that the temperature range they investigated is fairly limited. Scenario A2 yields the\ngreatest global temperature change by 2055, 3.4°C. Results are shown in Figure 15. While there are only\ntwo data points for each scenario, these plots indicate that higher temperatures are accompanied by a\nhigher incidence of diarrhoeal disease.\nFigure 15. Increase in diarrhoeal incidence\nGlobal Mean Temperature (C)\nHeat-related and cold-related mortality\nTol (2002a) produced estimates of the effects of climate change on both heat-related and cold-\nrelated mortality. With rising temperatures, one would expect to see a decrease in cold-related mortality\nand an increase in heat-related mortality. Tol extrapolated from a meta-analysis conducted by Martens\n(1998) that showed the reduction in cold-related cardiovascular deaths, the increase in heat-related\ncardiovascular deaths, and the change in heat-related respiratory deaths in 17 countries in the world. Tol\nscaled these results to a 1°C temperature change and extrapolated to the rest of the world’s countries by\nmeans of a statistical model. He assumed that heat-related cardiovascular mortality is mainly an urban\nphenomenon and that cold-related cardiovascular mortality and respiratory mortality affect the entire\npopulation. In a dynamic analysis, Tol (2002b) extrapolated these results over temperature changes beyond\n1°C. For the world as a whole, reduction in cold-related mortality is greater than the increase in heat-\nrelated deaths initially. He predicted reductions in mortality peak at rather moderate changes in\n***END OF PAGE 60***\n\n***START OF PAGE 61***\ntemperature, by 2050. From that point on, marginal changes in mortality are positive. His results are\ncharacterised by rather large uncertainty, but suggest that as temperatures continue to rise, there will be\nfewer reductions in cold-related mortality and more increases in heat-related mortality.\nMain findings\nThe relationship between climate change and total mortality and morbidity is complex. Climate\nchange could lead to the spread of more infectious disease, more heat stress, and more extreme events. All\nof these increase risk of mortality and morbidity. On the other hand, it is possible that a strong public\nhealth sector might substantially reduce these health risks. Also, an increase in temperature would be likely\nto reduce deaths from cold stress.\nIn spite of these inconsistent factors, we believe that health risks are more likely to increase than\ndecrease as GMT rises. While the results from the malaria studies we consider do not point to an\nunambiguous increase in risk as temperatures rise, they do tend to suggest that such an increase may be\nmore likely than not. However, this may not necessarily translate to an increase in mortality or morbidity.\nHijioka et al. also demonstrated that the threat of water borne diseases may increase as climate changes.\nThe limited results we examine for heat-related mortality suggest that, eventually, as temperatures rise so\nwill total mortality. There is more uncertainty regarding the magnitude and timing of reductions in cold-\nrelated mortality. Furthermore, many of these maladies are likely to increase in low latitude countries in\nparticular (heat stress will most likely increase in mid- and high latitudes as well). Low latitude nations\nhave some of the highest populations in the world and tend to be less developed and thus have more\nlimited public health sectors. It is possible that nations in low latitudes will develop improved public health\nsectors, but the speed and uniformity of such development are in doubt. In addition, there is little doubt that\nmost of the world’s population will live in low latitude countries in the 21st century given current\npopulation levels and projections of high growth (World Resources Institute, 2000). Taking all these\nconsiderations into account, it seems more likely that mortality and morbidity will rise than fall. We\ncharacterise the relationship between human health and climate change as one of increasing damages.\nHowever, given the inconsistencies in the results of the studies we examined and the difficulties in\naggregating these results, we note that further research is needed to unambiguously elucidate the nature of\nthis relationship.\n***END OF PAGE 61***\n\n***START OF PAGE 62***\n6. TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS PRODUCTIVITY\nClimate change could potentially affect a number of physical and biological processes on which\nthe health of terrestrial ecosystems depends. Changes in these ecosystem processes could in turn affect an\nequally diverse set of services on which people rely, including the flow of products obtained directly from\nsectors such as agriculture or forestry. Impacts to these two sectors are considered elsewhere in this report.\nIn addition, changes in these processes can affect services such as recreation and existence values.\nEcosystem impacts are also apt to affect indirect use services such as biodiversity. We examined the\nliterature on impacts of climate change on biodiversity in another section. However, a significant portion of\nthe overall value of terrestrial ecosystems could be related to nonmarket sorts of goods and services or\nservices not associated with concrete goods in any sense. These are all difficult values to measure, and no\nglobal studies of which we are aware attempt to quantify the impacts of climate change on terrestrial\necosystems by capturing the values of these sorts of services. Instead we focused on studies that examined\nthe general health and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems and presumably their ability to deliver a wide\nrange of services. The measures on which these studies rely are undoubtedly imperfect, but they do, in the\nauthors’ opinion, provide a sense of overall ecosystem productivity.\nWe examined two studies of the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems: White et al.\n(1999), which was part of the special issue, and Cramer et al. (2001). Only White et al. presented results on\na global level, but Cramer et al. is nonetheless informative in terms of approach and regional results.\nChoice of metric\nOne of the chief difficulties in assessing the effects of climate change on the health of terrestrial\necosystems is deciding what indicator best represents a measure of overall health. To some extent, this\ndepends on one’s interest. If the ability of the terrestrial biome to continue to absorb carbon from the\natmosphere is of chief interest, it would be most efficacious to investigate an indicator that measures the\nability to act as a carbon sink. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) would probably be the most appropriate\nindicator. If sheer productivity in terms of carbon fixed in a give period of time is of interest, net primary\nproductivity (NPP) is probably the appropriate measure. Total carbon would provide a cumulative measure\nof carbon stock. The two studies we examined provided estimates of all three sorts. However, only White\net al. provided results for these indicators at a global level, and these measures reveal nothing about the\ndiversity of vegetation (or fauna the vegetation supports). The most targeted indicator of diversity on a\nglobal level might be change in the area of vegetation types.\nScenarios\nWhite et al. relied on the same suite of GCMs as the other Special Issue studies, namely four\nsimulations of HadCM2 and the HadCM3 simulation. The temperature and precipitation changes over time\nfor the HadCM2 and HadCM3 simulations used by White et al. are shown in Table 4.\nCrane et al. explored three scenarios. The first considers changing CO2 but with an artificially\nconstant preindustrial climate. The second scenario allows climate to change, but holds CO2 at\n***END OF PAGE 62***\n\n***START OF PAGE 63***\npreindustrial levels. The final scenario allows both CO2 and climate to change. Their analysis assumed that\nan equilibrium is achieved at 2100, though they present results to 2199 to explore possible lags in the\nresponse of ecosystems to changes in CO2. Cramer et al. relied on the HadCM2-SUL simulation, which is\nsimilar to the simulation used by White et al. but includes the effects of sulfate aerosols (Johns et al.,\n1997). It is also forced by IS92a emissions. One of the main strengths of Cramer et al. is that the climatic\noutput from this GCM was fed in a transient fashion into the vegetation models.\nModels\nWhite et al. used a dynamic vegetation model that estimates change in location of vegetation\ntypes and productivity. Cramer et al. used six different dynamic vegetation models (including that of White\net al.), each with differing levels of complexity and emphasis on different functionalities, that provide\ntransient results.\nKey factors and assumptions\nBoth studies share a number of common assumptions and similarities. Since both relied on\ndynamic vegetation models, they both were able to capture the phenomena of competition, mortality, and\nchanges in ecosystem structure that govern the dynamics of vegetation change. However, White et al.\nsimulated growth of individual plants (typically trees), while many of the models used by Cramer et al.\nsimulate only vegetation classes. In addition, both studies did incorporate the physiological effect of\nincreased CO2. Transient changes in vegetation structure in turn can affect CO2 and water exchange\nbetween the land and atmosphere. However, because the vegetation models are run offline, these latter\nphenomena were not captured by either study. Furthermore, none of the vegetation models used in either\nstudy attempt to model land use.\nThe vegetation model used by White et al. does not capture the dynamic process of vegetation\ndispersal nor does it capture disturbances such as fire or disease. As such, it essentially produces\npredictions of potential vegetation. Several of the models employed by Cramer et al. capture this\nphenomenon, albeit in different ways. Furthermore, each study made an effort to incorporate climate\nvariance, White et al. by way of a stochastic weather generator and Cramer et al. by using the monthly\nvariance from GCM output (including average month by month minimum and maximum temperatures)\nwhen running the vegetation models.\nSpatial and distributional issues\nThe dynamic vegetation model that White et al. employed has ten 200 m2 plots within each GCM\ngrid cell. These model competition at the stand level, and results are aggregated globally. The analysis that\nCramer et al. conducted is fundamentally regional though it does provide global coverage. All six dynamic\nvegetation models were run at the same grid resolution as the climate model (3.75° longitude x 2.5°\nlatitude).\nGlobal results of terrestrial ecosystem response to climate change must be approached with some\ncaution. One would expect a complex pattern of regional results to emerge, since regional results are\nindependent of each other (unlike in economic models). So, results for particular regions could potentially\ndiffer dramatically from global results not only in magnitude but also in sign.\n***END OF PAGE 63***\n\n***START OF PAGE 64***\nResults\nGlobal results\nFigures 16, 17, and 18 depict the global changes in NPP, NEP and total carbon as function of\ntemperature from White et al. NPP increases fairly steadily until the 2050s, or about 2°C, at which point it\nbegins to level off. This global trend reflects an increase in NPP of northern forests in response to warming\nand increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and in some places precipitation. However, NPP decreases\nin southern Europe, the eastern United States, and many areas of the tropics. Areas where NPP declined\ngenerally correspond to the transformation of forest to savanna and grassland or desert. NEP, the difference\nbetween NPP and heterotrophic respiration, represents the net flux of carbon from between land and the\natmosphere. Decreases in NEP appear for both HadCM2 and HadCM3 after about 1.5°C of warming. In\nboth cases, White et al. reported, the decreases in NEP were associated with the decline or death of tropical\nor temperate forests. Thus, the Hybrid model predicted a growing terrestrial carbon sink, but a collapse and\nreversal of this sink at higher temperatures. White et al. also showed that global carbon begins to either\ndecrease or level off after about 2.5°C. This reflects the coincident levelling off of NPP. Though it is one\nof their few global results, Cramer et al. also indicated that the terrestrial carbon sink begins to level off by\n2050 and decreases by the end of the century.\nFigure 16.

The\nHadCM2 simulations suggested that the current carbon sink is centred in both the northern (30-60°N) and\ntropical forests (0-15°S). The northern sink (NEP) strengthened throughout the simulation, while the\nsouthern sink levelled off by the 2030s and became a source of carbon after the 2050s. HadCM3 predicted\nthat only the boreal forest region would remain a sink after the 2050s.\nMain findings\nIt reasonable to expect that the relationship between increased GMT and ecosystem productivity\nis parabolic. Higher atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will favourably affect plant growth and\ndemand for water (although change in growth may not result in increased biomass in natural, unmanaged,\nsystems). Higher temperatures, particularly if accompanied by increasing precipitation, could also initially\nbe favourable for plant growth.\nEventually, the increased growth will peak and then decline. The carbon dioxide fertilisation\neffect begins to saturate at higher CO2 concentrations (approximately 600 to 800 ppm for C3 plants;\nRosenzweig and Hillel, 1998). Thus additional CO2 no longer aids plant growth. Higher temperatures\nexponentially increase evapotranspiration, thus increasing water stress to vegetation.\nIn summary, there are biophysical reasons to expect vegetation productivity to increase with a\nsmall rise in global mean temperature, then peak, and eventually decline. The modelling results are\nconsistent with this hypothesis.\n***END OF PAGE 66***\n\n***START OF PAGE 67***\n7. FORESTRY\nWe reviewed one study of the impacts of climate change on global forestry, Sohngen et al.\n(2001). There are two additional studies of global forestry impacts, but at the time of this writing, we were\nunable to determine the changes in global mean temperature used in the studies (Perez-Garcia et al., 1997,\n2002). These studies are summarised in Tables 1 and 2, but only the Sohngen et al. paper is discussed.\nChoice of metric\nSohngen et al. estimated impacts of climate change on world timber markets. Their analysis was\ndesigned to not only capture the climate change driven ecological impacts on forest growth and distribution\nbut also provide insight into how landowners and markets adjust and adapt to global climate change. Doing\nso required that they estimate changes in several indicators: price, production, change in forest area,\nconsumer surplus, and producer surplus. Their results are aggregated across timber types.\nScenarios\nTwo climate models were used to provide input to the ecological model, UIUC (Schlesinger\net al., 1997) and Hamburg T-106 (Claussen, 1996). The two GCMs produce global climate forecasts for\ncurrent atmospheric CO2 concentrations (340 ppmv) and for an effective doubling scenario (550 ppmv).\nThe Hamburg model results in a 1°C increase in temperature globally; the UIUC model predicts a 3.4°C\nchange with doubled CO2. The Hamburg model predicts larger temperature changes in high latitudes than\nthe UIUC model, which predicts larger temperature changes in the low latitudes.\nSohngen et al. produced transient ecological scenarios that could be fed into the economic model,\nby assuming that climate and ecological response change linearly up to 2060, when equilibrium is assumed\nto occur. The period of analysis covers 150 years, with results presented for the near term (1995-2045) and\nthe long term (2045-2145). A long time horizon was used because climate change is expected to affect\nmarkets for forest products far into the future, partially because of the long intervals between regenerating\nstands and harvesting them.\nModels\nSohngen et al. relied on a dynamic model of ecological change coupled to an economic model.\nThe global ecological model, BIOME 3, which is a dynamic global vegetation model, predicts both shifts\nin the distribution of species and forest composition and changes in productivity. The economic model is\nan optimal control model.\n***END OF PAGE 67***\n\n***START OF PAGE 68***\nKey factors and assumptions\nSohngen et al. made a number of important underlying ecological and economic assumptions.\nOne such assumption, which was touched on in the discussion of scenarios, has to do with the conversion\nof BIOME3’s equilibrium predictions for 2060 to transient scenarios that are used by the economic model.\nThe authors assumed that these ecological changes occur proportionately and monotonically over this\nperiod. So, one-sixth of the expected shifts in forest type or productivity between 2000 and 2060 will occur\neach decade. Beyond 2060, climate is assumed to be stable. A second limitation of the Sohngen et al. study\nis that it did not account for land use change. It did, however, prohibit the encroachment of forests on farm\nland, protecting the ecological model from what the authors described as unlikely acquisitions of prime\ncropland by forest.\nThe second important assumption is that of a carbon fertilisation effect, through the physiological\neffects of increased carbon dioxide on water use efficiency of plants. In Sohngen et al., the carbon\nfertilisation effect enhances the gain in NPP by up to 35%. But recent studies of CO2 fertilisation in forests\nhave found that the effect is short-lived (e.g., Orem et al., 2001).\nOne of the real strengths of this sort of model is its capacity to account for the transplantation of\nspecies across the landscape. Accounting for both this movement and the CO2 effect is important, since\nchanges in NPP can affect species dominance within a forest and the species present can affect NPP.\nAccounting for the dynamics of how species are transplanted across landscapes is one of the challenges of\ndeveloping such an approach. Sohngen et al. considered two scenarios of this dynamic: dieback and\nregeneration. The dieback scenario predicts the loss of a large fraction of the existing stock as a forest type\nshifts due to climate change. The model relies on different assumptions as to what fraction of this dieback\ncan be salvaged according to how valuable or accessible the dieback is. The alternative scenario is that\nexisting trees will continue to grow but will not be able to regenerate successfully. With no dieback, forest\ntypes shift more slowly. This can in turn affect harvesting behaviour. Landowners may have an incentive\nto harvest young trees to make way for new species that could be more profitable under the changed\nconditions. The authors made several simple assumptions about the extent to which this happens and\nwhere.\nAnother assumption has to do with the baseline scenario developed by the authors. They assumed\nthat global demand for forest products increases at 1% per year; however, this growth is assumed to be\ngreater in developing countries and less in developed countries. Furthermore, it is outstripped by GDP,\nwhich is assumed to grow at 1.5%, reflecting the fact that manufacturing and consequently timber demand\nwill most likely shrink in the future as a fraction of GDP. Finally, interest rates are assumed to be constant\nat 5%.\nThe economic model also incorporates several key assumptions. Noteworthy is the assumption\nthat the relative value of timber species with respect to one another does not change. The authors focused\non a global price for timber. They also assumed that changes in merchantable timber growth are\nproportional to changes in NPP. However, NPP may not translate directly into yield (Shugart et al., in\npreparation). Finally, no attempt was made to account for nontimber forest products or nonmarket values\nof forests.\nSpatial and distributional issues\nA global market approach of the type undertaken by Sohngen et al. is particularly important for\nforestry given that climate change is apt to affect regions differently. Regional analyses can provide some\ninsight into how landowners and markets adjust, but cannot capture how the rest of the world responds.\n***END OF PAGE 68***\n\n***START OF PAGE 69***\nThis global picture of supply and demand is critical to assessing the impacts of climate change on forestry.\nWhile, as with all sectors, it is important to keep sight of the regional picture of impacts, forest products\nare traded globally, so gains in one region will offset losses in another to large extent. The situation is\nsimilar to agriculture: consumers will be affected by global change in prices, while effects on producers\nwill vary.\nBecause the ecological model used provides more disaggregated results than the economic model\ncan use, this output was aggregated for each contiguous forest type for each of nine timber producing\nregions. These aggregated ecological effects were used to predict changes in economic indicators in each\nof the regions. Results were presented both on a regional basis and globally.\nResults\nGlobal results\nThe results in Sohngen et al. detail changes in consumer and producer surplus under both dieback\nand regeneration scenarios. Sohngen et al. also explored, via sensitivity analysis, the effect of higher or\nlower interest rates, assumptions about the ability of forests to expand, and future competition for\nplantation sites in the tropics. The general results are the same. Global timber supply increases and prices\ndecline under all scenarios and assumptions. Global net surplus increases, consumers benefit because\nprices are lower, high latitude producers tend to lose, and low to midlatitude producers tend to gain. Figure\n19 depicts results for timber production.\nFigure 19. Percentage change in timber production for three 50-year time periods\nTime period\nHamburg (1°C)\nUIUC (3.4°C)\nEquilibrium assumed to occur at 2060\nSource: Sohngen et al., 2001\n***END OF PAGE 69***\n\n***START OF PAGE 70***\nGlobal yields clearly increase over time because of two factors. First, climate change increases\nthe annual growth of merchantable timber by increasing NPP. Second, the BIOME3 predicts a poleward\nmigration of more productive species, which tends to increase the area of these more productive species.\nHowever, while global forest yields rise, global temperatures appear to have a small effect on\noutput. Both the Hamburg and UIUC models show comparable gains in yield at each time step, though\ntheir underlying global temperature predictions are quite different (approximately 1°C versus 3.4°C). There\nare significant differences between the two climate models in terms of regional and temporal temperature\npatterns. For instance, in the Hamburg scenario, production increases most heavily in low to midlatitude\nregions where climate changes are mild and growth is stimulated by increased carbon dioxide. In the UIUC\nmodel, production increases are similar for all regions. This pattern of regional differences between the two\nmodels continues and leads to the global aggregate trends depicted in Figure 19. One thing that is\nconsistent is that when baseline conditions and time are held constant, the higher temperature scenario,\nUIUC, predicts slightly lower benefits than the low temperature Hamburg scenario. Our conclusions about\nthe relationship between GMT and global forestry production are discussed below.\nRegional results\nWhile there are regional differences in how producers are affected, the pattern is different and\nmore complex than in other sectors. Rather than facing losses, lower latitude producers are able to take\nadvantage of climate change almost immediately, and expand short-rotation plantations. This expansion\nallows for higher production while world prices are close to baseline levels, just as other areas are\nexperiencing dieback. In contrast, producers in mid- to high latitude regions are susceptible to the effects\nof dieback, and it takes many years before they experience growth increases because of their long-rotation\nspecies. Eventually though, this stock is replaced by more productive southern species and production\nincreases, accompanied by a decline in world prices.\nMain findings\nWe would expect the economic results for forestry to roughly track biophysical changes in\nterrestrial vegetation. When growth is estimated to increase, we would expect production to rise as well. If\ngrowth decreases at some point, production should too. This is the case in agriculture. Since we had only\none forestry study to examine and taking into consideration the complexities of lags resulting from decadal\nlong harvesting times, it is more difficult to draw a conclusion here. It does appear that everything else\nequal, both climate change scenarios in Sohngen et al. result in benefits, albeit the scenario with higher\nGMT has slightly lower benefits. This suggests, but does not confirm, that the relationship between GMT\nand global forest production is parabolic. Without more studies looking at wider range of climate changes,\nwe cannot draw a definitive conclusion.\n***END OF PAGE 70***\n\n***START OF PAGE 71***\n8. MARINE ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY\nWe examined one study that analysed changes in the production of marine ecosystems due to\nclimate change: Bopp et al. (2001).\nChoice of metric\nBopp et al. attempted to predict how climate change might affect marine primary production\n(production by marine plants, including phytoplankton and seaweeds). As with terrestrial ecosystem\nproductivity, this one metric is limited and does not directly translate into fish productivity or changes in\nbiodiversity. However, any changes in primary production would propagate up the marine food web and\nconsequently indicate the possible effects of climate change on marine ecosystems in general. For instance,\ninterannual variations in marine productivity due to El Niño can dramatically affect ocean fishery yields\nand the human populations that rely on them. Specifically, Bopp et al. estimated the change in marine\nexport production, that part of the primary production that is transported below 100 m.\nScenarios\nBopp et al. considered a future of doubled CO2 and used the oceanic output (advection and eddy\ndiffusion) from two different coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (LMD5 and Arpege). Their baseline\nclimatology holds CO2 constant at 350 ppm, and the global warming scenario increases CO2 at 1% per year\nuntil reaching a doubling of CO2 after 70 years (they also consider a tripling and quadrupling of CO2 in a\nlimited fashion, occurring at 110 and 140 years, respectively). The primary 2xCO2 model runs, however,\nextend to 80 years in the future. They did not provide a corresponding record of global average transient\ntemperatures for the GCMs. Sea surface temperature, however, changes between 1.25°C and 1.5°C over\nthe course of the experiment.11 The analysis did not account for changes in extreme events, variance, or a\nstate change such as the breakdown of thermohaline circulation.\nModels\nBopp et al. used the GCM outputs as input into two biogeochemical schemes, HAMOCC3 and\nP3ZD. Only the second biogeochemical scheme explicitly models plankton dynamics. The biogeochemical\nschemes are run off line.\nKey factors and assumptions\nBopp et al. made several assumptions that bear noting. First, because their biogeochemical\nmodels were run off line, the analysis did not provide for feedback to the climate system from changes in\nthe ocean’s biochemistry. In fact, the analysis did not allow them to distinguish dynamic from\n11.  At the time of this writing, we are unable to determine what change in global mean temperatures are associated\nwith these changes in sea surface temperatures.\n***END OF PAGE 71***\n\n***START OF PAGE 72***\nbiogeochemical effects. Second, the biogeochemical schemes they employed are grossly simplified in that\nthey are phosphate based and lack limitation by other nutrients (e.g., Fe, N, Si). Finally, the models they\nemployed do not account for competition between different species of plankton or that species abundance\nmay change because of climate induced changes in ocean circulation or mixing.\nSpatial scales and distributional issues\nOverall spatial resolution was determined by the resolution of the constituent GCMs, 2° longitude\nx 1.5° latitude. The results were presented cartographically on the grid level and as zonal regional averages\nand global averages.\nResults\nWe discuss the global and regional results under the same heading here because they are closely\nrelated in this sector.\nBoth combinations of models predicted similar responses to climate change. At 2xCO2 they\npredicted a 6% global decrease in export production, and showed opposing changes in the high and low\nlatitude regions. In the low latitudes, climate induced changes in the ocean decreased export production by\n20%, but increased export production 30% in the high latitudes. Reductions in low latitude export\nproduction are located primarily in the Indian Ocean, Tropical Atlantic, and Western Pacific. Examining\nthe results in the economically important fisheries region of the equatorial Pacific indicates that export\nproduction decreased by 5 to 15%. In general, changes in production are driven by reduced nutrient\nsupplies in the low latitudes and an increased light efficiency in the high latitudes due to a longer growing\nseason. Both changes result from increased stratification in the upper ocean. Despite the general\nconcordance of the two models, there are substantial regional discrepancies.\nResults were not reported for lower levels of climate change, so it is not possible to determine if\nglobal export production declines at smaller increments of increase in global mean temperature.\nOther factors\nReducing uncertainties in ocean dynamics is a crucial first step to improving estimates of the\nimpact of climate change on marine productivity. The Southern Ocean is particularly sensitive to such\nuncertainty, and improving forecasts for this important region will also rely on better higher resolution\nmodels and better sea-ice models. Explicit inclusion of other nutrients in biogeochemical models will lead\nto improvements in the future.\nMain findings\nWith only one study containing few data points, it is difficult to draw conclusions about how\nmarine ecosystem productivity is related to increased GMT. Clearly, at some point, increasing GMT leads\nto reduced marine ecosystem productivity. It is reasonable to assume that further increases in GMT lead to\nfurther decreases in productivity, but we are uncertain about the relationship between GMT and marine\necosystem productivity for temperature changes less than those considered by Bopp et al.\n***END OF PAGE 72***\n\n***START OF PAGE 73***\n9. BIODIVERSITY\nWe examined one study that informs speculation regarding the impacts of climate change on\nglobal biodiversity: Halpin (1997).\nChoice of metric\nEstimating the impacts of climate change on the global abundance and distribution of\nbiodiversity is a tall, if not impossible, order. Halpin took on this task in an indirect matter. He\nhypothesised that the survival and distribution of terrestrial plant and animal species depend on the\ndistribution of the climates on which they depend. Specifically, Halpin examined the potential threat\nclimate change poses to global nature reserve systems, the repositories of significant biodiversity. Since\nclimate change affects the distribution of climate zones, species may move within or beyond the confines\nof existing nature reserve boundaries. Halpin estimated the percentage of biosphere reserves that might\nexperience a significant change in “ecoclimatic class” as well as the global average change for all\nterrestrial areas. A change from a current ecoclimate class to a different class was interpreted as a\nsignificant climate impact for a reserve site.\nGitay et al. (2001) noted that this approach contains many limitations and in particular cautioned\nagainst identifying species-specific impacts. While the approach used by Halpin estimates long-term\nchanges, biomes experiencing changed climate may be able to tolerate new conditions. However, even if\nhabitat survives changes in climate, the migration of new species into a region and the subsequent\ncompetition may mean that biomes are changed fundamentally.\nScenarios\nThe four GCMs used in Halpin’s analysis were run for a doubled CO2 scenario. As with other\nstudies using this battery of GCMs, equilibrium was presumed to occur at 2090. The associated\ntemperature changes are shown in Table 3. Since the scenarios are equilibrium and not transient, impact\ntrends according to temperature were deduced via cross-model comparison.\nModels\nHalpin compared current climate data bases and modified climate grids. He used a 19 class,\naggregated ecoclimatic structure for the world. The current ecoclimatic classes of the UNESCO biosphere\nreserves network (MAB-UNESCO, 1990) were compared to the ecoclimatic projections generated by the\nUKMO, GISS, GFDL, and OSU GCMs.\nThe analysis predicted sites where the climatic change falls within the existing climatic range of\nthe bioreserve and sites where the projected change exceeds the current range. It was presumed that\nbiodiversity in reserves that have a change in climate will be threatened.\n***END OF PAGE 73***\n\n***START OF PAGE 74***\nSpatial scales and distributional issues\nHalpin presents results on both global and zonal bases.\nKey factors and assumptions\nThis sort of geographic assessment makes no attempt to predict the specific biotic outcomes of\nprojected changes for the particular species composition contained with the reserves. A multitude of factors\nthat are ignored will influence actual outcomes. For example, the study did not address how biodiversity\nwill be threatened. Will change in climate exceed climatic tolerances of species, allow other species better\nsuited for the new climate to migrate into the reserve and outcompete the current occupants, or lead to\ndisturbance? One important consideration, however, that was not investigated, and on which the ability of\nactual species to migrate or adapt to climate change will depend, is rates of change. Species may well be\nable to migrate along with ecoclimatic zones or may be able to adapt to new ecoclimatic classes. However,\nit is likely that the rate at which ecoclimatic zones migrate may control both abilities. Furthermore, human\ndevelopment and other topographic boundaries can limit or impede migration by imposing barriers. This\ncould particularly be the case with reserves. At a minimum, this approach indicates the potential for\nclimate change to introduce risks to biodiversity.\nResults\nBecause global results are closely linked to regional results in this sector, we discuss them\ntogether.\nFigure 20 displays the frequency with which biosphere reserves and terrestrial area in general\nexperience a change in ecoclimatic class as a function of temperature. With the exception of a hitch around\na 4°C change, presumably due to the difference in precipitation between GISS and GFDL, the trend is\ngenerally increasing and linear. While the GCM scenarios project major changes in the distribution of\necoclimate classes at a global scale, the more important point is that the frequency of ecoclimatic impacts\non reserve areas is generally higher than the global averages. Halpin suggested a fairly straightforward\nexplanation. The global distribution of reserves has a northern spatial bias, because of the greater\nabundance of land mass at northern latitudes and the fact that northern industrialised nations maintain more\nreserve sites. This bias coincides with the larger magnitude climate impacts projected by the GCMs that\nHalpin used. This produces higher rates of climate change for reserve sites than the average for terrestrial\nareas.\n***END OF PAGE 74***\n\n***START OF PAGE 75***\nFigure 20. Percent change in ecoclimatic classes for biosphere reserves compared to global average\nBiosphere Reserves\nTotal Terrestrial Area\nGFDL\nGISS\nUKMO\nSource: Halpin, 1997\nOther factors\nFuture studies could improve on this analysis by investigating shifts in ecoclimatic class under\ntransient climate change scenarios, giving important insight into rates of climate change and the ability of\nspecies to adapt or migrate. Those studies could also attempt to better assess the consequences of changes\nin ecoclimate zones. Future studies must also do a better job of characterising and exploring dispersal\nmechanisms and barriers to migration, which might be geophysical (including fragmented habitat in\ngeneral), climatic, or ecological (competition).\nMain findings\nIt seems highly likely that larger increases in GMT this century will result in more losses of\nbiodiversity, for two reasons. Many species may be able to tolerate a certain level of change in climate, but\nat higher levels of change, these thresholds will be exceeded. Higher GMTs also mean faster rates of\nchange in climate, which will exceed the ability of increasing numbers of species to adapt. In addition, the\nthreat to biodiversity from climate is much larger when considered in conjunction with the pressures of\ndevelopment. Habitat fragmentation and pollution among other factors already threaten many species. In\ncombination with climate change, the loss could be larger. The IPCC concluded, “There is little evidence\nto suggest that processes associated with climate change will slow species loss” (Gitay et al., 2001; p. 250).\nWe are highly confident that biodiversity will decrease with increasing temperatures; what is uncertain is\nwhether there is a straight line relationship or exponential relationship between higher GMT and loss of\nbiodiversity.\n***END OF PAGE 75***\n\n***START OF PAGE 76***\n10. ENERGY\nWe are aware of only one study that estimated the effects of climate change on the demand for\nglobal energy: the energy sector analysis of Tol’s (2002b) aggregate study (discussed in Section 11). Tol\nfollowed the method of Downing et al. (1996). Climatic change is likely to affect the consumption of\nenergy via changes in the demand for space heating and cooling. As global temperatures rise, the global\ndemand for heating is likely to decrease, while the demand for cooling is likely to increase. Tol relied on\nDowning et al.’s global study, which in turn extrapolated from a simple country-specific (United\nKingdom) model that relates the energy used for heating or cooling to degree days, per capita income, and\nenergy efficiency. Economic impacts were derived from energy price scenarios and extrapolated to the rest\nof the world. Tol also reported that Downing et al. argued that the demand for heating decreases linearly as\ntemperature increases. They also assumed that virtually all homes and buildings that need heating have it.\nEnergy efficiency was assumed to increase over time.\nIn developing a model for the demand for cooling energy, Downing et al. assumed demand for\ncooling to increase roughly linearly with temperature. Air conditioning was assumed not to have saturated\nall buildings and homes that could use it. As with the model for heating energy, demand for cooling was\nassumed to increase with population. Again, efficiency gains reduce the costs.\nResults\nAccording to Tol’s best guess parameters, by 2100, benefits (reduced heating) are about 0.75% of\nGDP and damages (increased cooling) are approximately 0.45%. The global savings from reduced demand\nfor heating remain below 1% of GDP through 2200. However, by the 22nd century, they begin to level off\nbecause of increased energy efficiency. For cooling, the additional amount spent rises to just above 0.6%\nof GDP by 2200. Thus throughout the next two centuries, net energy demand decreases. Tol, however, did\nnot report how temperature changes over this period, so we cannot associate a particular level of net\nbenefits with a given temperature. Despite the results at 2200, it is reasonable to assume that at high\nenough levels of temperature change, the increased spending on cooling will come to dominate the savings\nfrom reduced expenditure on heating.\nMain findings\nWe are highly confident that global energy use will eventually rise as global mean temperature\nrises, but we are not certain about whether a few degrees of warming will lead to increased or decreased\nenergy consumption. With higher temperatures, demand for heating decreases and demand for cooling\nincreases. One can imagine that a curve relating energy demand to mean global temperature might be\nshaped like “U” or a “V” (Figure 21). An important question is whether we are to the right of the low point\nof such a curve (where further increases in temperature increase total demand), in which case global energy\nconsumption will rise with higher GMT, or whether we are on the portion of the curve that foretells\ndecreasing demand (left of the low point), in which case global energy consumption will first decline and\nthen eventually rise as GMT increases. Tol’s analysis suggests that we are can still look forward to\nreductions in total consumption. However, Mendelsohn’s (2001) analysis of the United States finds that\n***END OF PAGE 76***\n\n***START OF PAGE 77***\nenergy costs will increase even with an approximate 1°C increase in GMT. Since the United States\nconsumes about one-fourth of global energy, this may be indication that global energy demand will\nincrease immediately as temperatures rise. Thus, based on the limited literature, we are unable to determine\nthe effective shape of the damage relationship we face. We consequently conclude that we are uncertain\nabout the relationship between energy demand and increased GMT.\nFigure 21.

AGGREGATE\nWe briefly examined two aggregate studies that analysed the global impacts of climate change\nacross a number of sectors. As with the individual sectors, we discuss the methods used, basic\nassumptions, and results for each study. The two studies we examined are Tol (2002a, 2002b) and\nNordhaus and Boyer (2000).\nTol’s study considered impacts of climate change on agriculture; forestry; species, ecosystems,\nand landscapes; sea level rise; human health; energy consumption; and water resources. It omitted impacts\nrelated to amenity values, recreation, tourism, extreme weather, fisheries, construction, transport, energy\nsupply, and morbidity. Tol derived estimates of the impacts of climate change from the literature. He\nlimited consideration to those studies that are both globally comprehensive and based on climate scenarios\ngenerated by GCMs. The meta-analysis ties impacts to changes in global mean temperature and splits the\nworld into nine regions. He conducted both a static analysis of the impacts of a 1°C change in global\ntemperature on the present situation and a dynamic estimate of the potential impacts over the 2000-2200\nperiod, taking into account the vulnerability of regions to impacts (changes in population, economies, and\ntechnology are considered, although uncertainties about these scenarios are ignored). Tol manipulated the\nresults of published studies to match his regions, and scaled their results to correspond to the 1°C change\nhe examined. He also adjusted the results of some studies to make assumptions regarding adaptation\nconsistent. In some cases, he also modified results to capture other dimensions of impacts that the original\nstudies did not (e.g., inclusion of forced migration costs as part of sea level rise study results). During this\nprocess he made several broad assumptions, one of which is that regions are homogenous. Expanding his\nanalysis to one that is dynamic necessitated adopting many more assumptions and extrapolating, by means\nof statistical methods, his static findings over different climates and different vulnerabilities to climate\nchange. The necessary parameters were estimated from the underlying literature or guessed. He did,\nhowever, conduct a sensitivity analysis of key parameters to determine the effect of his choice of\nparameters.\nTol’s results show that the impacts of climate change can be positive as well as negative,\ndepending on the sector, region, or time period at which one is looking. The impact on overall welfare\ndepends on how one decides to aggregate results. Aggregating results across regions, even when results are\nexpressed in monetary fashion as they are in Tol’s analysis, is problematic. Statistical lives, for instance,\nmay be valued differently in different regions, and thus different weights could be assigned to the results\nfor each region according to a chosen indicator. Tol aggregates static results both as simple sums and in an\nequity weighted fashion, where income determines the weighting factors. The simple sum results in a 2.3%\nincrease in income globally. The equity weighted sum reduces this figure to 0.2% of income.\nRegional aggregate impacts can differ substantially from global aggregate impacts and from region to\nregion. Especially at low magnitudes of climate change, results are likely to be mixed across regions. For\nan increase of 1ºC in global mean temperature and a .2 meter sea level rise as above, impacts in the OECD,\nCentral and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and China are on balance positive.\nIn all other regions, impacts are on balance negative. At low levels of climate change most developing\ncountries, especially those in the low latitudes, are negatively impacted. Table 7 presents Tol’s results for a\n***END OF PAGE 78***\n\n***START OF PAGE 79***\nbenchmark 1ºC change. Other studies such as Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) estimate different regional\nresults.\nTable 7.

Dollars are 1990 US dollars.  Positive values\nare benefits and negative values are damages.  The last three rows represent three different approaches to\naggregation and lead to very different outcomes.  The simple sum (i) approach is output based and constructed from\nthe individual regional estimates which use different monetary values for different impacts.  This approach ignores\ndisparities between the regional estimates.  Average value (ii) approach uses globally averaged prices to value non-\nmarket goods and services.  The sign switch between the simple sum and average value aggregates is largely due to\nthe valuation of mortality where using world average values rather than regionally differentiated values place the\nemphasis on the increase in mortality in developing countries, compared to the decrease in mortality in the OECD.\nThe equity-weighted sum (iii) approach uses the ratio of global to regional income per capita as an equity weight.  The\ndifference with simple summation is due to higher weights for the poorest regions which tend to have relatively higher\nlevel of negative impacts compared to other regions.\nSource: from Tol (2002a)\nThe picture of dynamic results is also mixed (Tol, 2002b). There are both positive and negative\nimpacts for different regions at different points in time. Dynamic results are not aggregated globally. For\nthe OECD countries, Tol predicts that the overall impact of climate change over the next two centuries will\nbe positive, though the complete time series begins and ends with predicted damages. The overall results\nfor Latin America are similar, as are those for the Middle East and Centrally Planned Asia. However, the\nentire curve is shifted closer toward damages for the last two regions. The impacts of climate change on\nSouth and Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union are on the whole\nnegative. All results for Africa are negative. By the end of the analysis period, 2200, annual results for all\nregions are negative, with the exception of the Middle East and Centrally Planned Asia. Clearly, results at\nthe regional level tell a different story, than global results do, in terms of impacts as a function of time and\nsimilarly, in terms of sensitivity of impacts to temperature.\nNordhaus and Boyer’s aggregate analysis relied on an integrated model, the Regional dynamic\nIntegrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE). Global impact is derived from regional impact\n***END OF PAGE 79***\n\n***START OF PAGE 80***\nestimates. RICE includes eight regions, though for their analysis Nordhaus and Boyer divided these eight\nregions into 13 subregions. Climate change is represented by global mean surface temperature. The study\nis dynamic and results are derived first for 2.5°C of change (the average change corresponding to a\ndoubling of CO2 from three climate scenarios considered). Damage functions are then inferred that extend\nthe analysis to 6°C of warming. The model takes a willingness-to-pay approach, estimating the insurance\npremium different societies are willing to pay to prevent climate change and its associated impacts.\nParameters are estimated based on existing studies, modification of existing results, guessing, and survey\nresults. The Nordhaus and Boyer analysis is unique among aggregate studies in its attempted inclusion of\nnonmarket and potential catastrophic impacts as well as market impacts. The study estimated impacts in\nagriculture, sea level rise, other market sectors, health, nonmarket amenity impacts, human settlements and\necosystems, and catastrophic events.\nNordhaus and Boyer presented aggregate damage curves for regions and by weighted summation,\nwhere weights are based on population or projected 2100 regional output (Figure 22).\nFigure 22. Regional damage functions\nSource: Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000\nThe impacts of a 2.5°C warming range from benefits of 0.7% of output for Russia to net damages\nof almost 5% for India. The global average of damages for a 2.5° warming is 1.5% if weighted by output or\n***END OF PAGE 80***\n\n***START OF PAGE 81***\n1.9% if weighted by 1995 population.12  One important distributional result is that low income areas, India\nand Africa in particular, and Europe are subject to significant damages over the next century. For most\ncountries, market impacts are small in comparison to the possibility of potential catastrophic impacts. The\nlarge uncertainty associated with these catastrophic impact estimates implies that there is great uncertainty\nassociated with the overall results. Nordhaus’ and Boyer’s results also demonstrate that the method of\nspatial aggregation has an important effect not only on the total magnitude of global climate change\nimpacts, but also on the contribution of particular sectors to that total (Figure 23).\nFigure 23. Global impacts in different sectors and according to method of aggregation\nAggregation method\nCatastrophic impact (2.5 degrees)\nSettlements\nNonmarket time use\nHealth\nCoastal\nOther vulnerable market\nAgriculture\nAggregated by Output\nAggregated by Population\nNotes: Estimated aggregate impacts at 2.5 o C change in global mean temperature. Sectors placed above the 0% of\nGDP line show damages (of positive magnitude). Sectors below the 0% of GDP line are benefits or negative impacts;\nwhich in this case is Nonmarket time value. Total global damages are not explicitly indicated, but can be computed by\nsubtracting benefit categories from total damages, that is, benefits below the x-axis from those above. The net effect\nbased on the output aggregated approach is a damage of 1.5% of GDP. For the results weighted by population,\nNordhaus and Boyer (2000) report a global total of 1.88% of GDP. However, when the population-weighted\naggregated sectoral results presented above are totaled, the present authors arrive at 2.2% of GDP. Population\nweighted global average is weighted according to population in 1995. Output weighted global averages are weighted\nby projected output in 2100. Finally, nonmarket time use generally refers to the estimates of the value of the total time\npeople spend on climate sensitive recreational activity, which Nordhaus and Boyer estimate increase with higher levels\nof climate change.\n12 For the results weighted by population, Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) report a global total of 1.88% of GDP.\nHowever, when the population-weighted aggregated sectoral results presented above are totaled, the\npresent authors arrive at 2.2% of GDP.\n***END OF PAGE 81***\n\n***START OF PAGE 82***\nFor instance, aggregating by output gives more weight to impacts in developed countries .This\nresults in more benefits compared to population weighted impacts in the case of non-market use time.\nWeighting by population tends to emphasize impacts in populous developing countries and especially the\ncontribution of vulnerable sectors such as health to the aggregated total. The net effect is that weighting by\noutput results in smaller damages than weighting by population.\nMain findings\nThe few studies on aggregate impacts of climate change consistently estimate that there will be\ndamages beyond approximately 2 to 3°C of increase in GMT (Figure 24).\nFigure 24.

For example, with\nrespect to the coverage of non-market impacts, such as impacts on ecosystems and human health Tol’s figures\ninclude estimates of ecosystem damages using gross estimates of willingness to pay to preserve ecosystems. He also\nprovides estimates of the value of loss of human life. In contrast, the Mendelsohn and Schlesinger’s figures omit non-\nmarket damages entirely. Nordhaus and Boyer on the other hand, include estimates of catastrophic damages based\non willingness to pay to avoid extreme events, value of loss of human life, amenity values associated with climate, and\nvalue of time (e.g., recreation). The other studies do not include these categories of impacts. However, Nordhaus and\nBoyer do not directly estimate value of ecosystem impacts (e.g., willlingness-to-pay to protect endangered species) as\nTol does.\nSource: Smith et al. 2001, citing Mendelsohn and Schlesinger 1999; Nordhaus and Boyer 2000; Tol 2002b\nDamages are estimated to continue increasing at higher increases in temperature. Where there is\ndisagreement among the studies concerns what happens for smaller increases in GMT. Some studies show\nnet benefits for a small amount of warming, while Nordhaus and Boyer show damages at such levels.\n***END OF PAGE 82***\n\n***START OF PAGE 83***\nThus, the aggregate studies do not present consistent results concerning the shape of the damages curve,\nbut do consistently show increasing damages at higher magnitudes of climate change. For a few degrees of\nincrease in mean global temperature, aggregate impacts appear to be uncertain.\n***END OF PAGE 83***\n\n***START OF PAGE 84***\n12. DISCUSSION\nThis section discusses the main findings of our survey of the literature on global sectoral studies.\nWe did not attempt to aggregate the results from various studies and sectors but assessed whether there are\nconsistent patterns of relationships between impacts and GMT. We then examined the uncertainties\nassociated with these studies, and whether they have adequately and appropriately accounted for factors\nthat can substantially affect estimates of impacts. We also looked at related topics, including choice of\nmetrics, time scales, spatial and distributional issues, proactive adaptation, and ancillary benefits. The\nsection concludes by making some recommendations on research needs.\nTotal impacts\nGiven the state of knowledge on how impacts in specific sectors change as GMT increases, what\nare the total impacts across sectors from climate change as a function of increasing GMT?\nDetermining total impacts would be trivial if all of the impact studies used the same metric. If all\nimpacts were measured in dollars, number of lives affected or some other common metric, we could\nsimply sum the numbers from individual sector studies.13 However, even with a common metric, we would\nencounter the sorts of stumbling blocks outlined in the introduction. Simple summation of monetized\nimpacts across regions or sectors would give the wealthy more weight than the poor. The use of people at\nrisk or lives affected could overstate the true impacts because some people may be affected in more than\none sector. Since the studies we reviewed use different metrics, we cannot aggregate results; nor do we\nattempt to transform results presented in one metric to another in order to do so.\nInstead, we looked for common patterns between the damage relationships presented for different\nsectors. Do impacts increase as temperatures rise, are there thresholds, does the sign of impacts reverse as\ntemperature rises (parabolic), or is the relationship indeterminate? Table 8 summarises the patterns in the\nstudies we examined by sector, and the most obvious conclusion is that there are different relationships\nbetween impacts and temperature across the sectors.\n13.  In reality, even with the benefit of a common metric, simply summing damages from various sectors would not be\nentirely accurate. Such an approach would still not account for important interactions between sectors and would\nomit sectors for which there are no estimated global impacts, such as migration.\n***END OF PAGE 84***\n\n***START OF PAGE 85***\nTable 8.

Increasing adverse impacts means there are adverse impacts with small increases in GMT,\nand the adverse impacts increase with higher GMTs. We are unable to determine whether the\nadverse impacts increase linearly or exponentially with GMT.\nb. There is some uncertainty associated with this characterisation, as the results for the studies\nwe examine are inconsistent. On balance, we believe the literature shows increasing damages\nfor this sector\nc. We believe this is parabolic, but with only one study it is difficult to ascertain temperature\nrelationship, so there is uncertainty about this relationship.\nd. This relationship is uncertain because there is only one study on this topic.\nSome of the sectors exhibit increasing adverse impacts with increasing degrees of climate\nchange. Since the data reported in the studies are limited, we were generally unable to determine if these\nrelationships are linear or exponential. None of sector-specific relationships appear to be characterised by\nthresholds below which there is no impact. Some sectors are characterised by a parabolic relationship\nbetween temperature and impacts, and for the others, the relationship is unknown.\nThere appear to be increasing adverse impacts with higher GMT in the coastal resources, marine\necosystems, human health, and biodiversity sectors. It is highly probable that adverse impacts in the coastal\nand biodiversity sectors will rise with increasing magnitudes of climate change. This confidence arises not\nonly from an examination of the aforementioned studies but also from an understanding of the exposure\nand sensitivity of these systems. We are less certain for human health and marine ecosystems.\nThe results for the studies on human health are not entirely consistent. Furthermore, there are real\nquestions as to how to aggregate results and if doing so is possible at all, since different health threats\nreflect different types and degrees of risk. On balance, though, these studies and our knowledge of the\nsector do seem to suggest the possibility of increasing risk with increasing GMT.\nThe information on marine ecosystems is limited. We presume that marine ecosystem\nproductivity will continue to decline as temperatures move beyond those considered in the one published\nstudy on this topic. Whether there are reductions in productivity (net adverse impacts) at lower levels of\ntemperature or gains (net benefits) is uncertain. We do not have enough information to determine whether\n***END OF PAGE 85***\n\n***START OF PAGE 86***\nthere adverse impacts right from the start or if there is a parabolic relationship with increasing GMT.\nFurthermore, there are no global studies that quantify how decreased marine primary productivity might\naffect the rest of the food chain.\nThere appears to be a parabolic relationship between impacts and GMT for terrestrial ecosystem\nproductivity and agriculture. The terrestrial ecosystem productivity studies consistently estimated increased\nproductivity at small magnitudes of climate change, but decreased productivity at larger magnitudes. The\nrelationship between impacts and temperature in agriculture is somewhat less consistent from study to\nstudy, but nonetheless seems to be parabolic. Some of the studies we reviewed estimated benefits from\nsmall increases in GMT (Rosenzweig et al., 1995 and Darwin et al., 1995), while one showed adverse\nimpacts (Parry et al., 1999). All three agriculture studies estimated reduced global production (i.e., adverse\nimpacts) beyond an approximate 3 to 4°C increase in GMT. Both the White et al. (1999) and Cramer et al.\n(2001) studies of terrestrial ecosystem productivity clearly indicate that initial gains in productivity are\nfollowed by reductions; the relationship between terrestrial ecosystem productivity and GMT is likely to be\nparabolic.\nThe Sohngen et al. (2001) study of forestry indicated a slight negative effect of relatively higher\ntemperatures. Since both scenarios in the study considered estimate net increase in forest production and\nthe warmer scenario shows a slight reduction in benefits, the relationship between GMT and production\nmay be parabolic. However, the results are complicated by factors (including time lags) that make it\ndifficult to determine the underlying relationship between increases in GMT and forestry impacts in this\nstudy. Yet the fact that the terrestrial vegetation productivity studies point to a parabolic relationship, and\nthat economic output should move consistently with biophysical change, indicates that forestry is likely to\nhave a parabolic relationship with temperature. We think the relationship is parabolic, but put a question\nmark in Table 8 because the literature on global forest production and climate change is limited.\nThe relationship between impacts and change in climate is clearly uncertain for a number of\nsectors that are sensitive to climate. This is particularly true for water resources, for which it is hard to\ndetermine whether impacts increase or decrease.\nOur conclusions regarding energy are based on only one study, Tol’s reanalysis of the work by\nDowning et al. (1996); other studies indicate that results could be different. Consequently, we cannot\ndetermine with any certainty what the next few degrees of warming will bring.\nWhat does this mean taken together? Since the different sector studies do not show a consistent\nrelationship, it is not possible to draw a conclusion about whether impacts generally increase as\ntemperature rises or whether there is a parabolic relationship. Given the fact that several studies show some\nimpact with even small amounts of temperature change, we can rule out the threshold relationship. Beyond\nan approximate 3 to 4°C increase in global mean temperature, all of the studies we examined, with the\npossible exception of forestry, show increasing adverse impacts. In total, it appears likely that there are\nincreasing adverse impacts beyond this level. However, the relationship between total impacts and climate\nchange up to a 3 to 4°C increase in GMT remains uncertain. Not only is the shape of the curve uncertain,\nbut whether it lies above or below the adverse impacts/benefits line or traces it between 0°C and 3 to 4°C is\nalso uncertain.\nIt is interesting to consider whether the studies of aggregate impacts give us any additional\ninsight. Examination of Figure 24 reveals that beyond approximately the same threshold of 3 to 4°C, the\naggregate studies tend to find that there are increasing net damages. Below approximately 3 to 4°C, the\nstudies diverge. Mendelsohn and Schlesinger (1999) and Tol (2002b) estimated initial net benefits, which\npeak and then decline. Nordhaus and Boyer estimated damages from the start, which then increase\nexponentially with temperature.\n***END OF PAGE 86***\n\n***START OF PAGE 87***\nIn summary, the literature shows that for increases in GMT between 0°C and 3 to 4°C, the\nrelationship between impacts and temperature is uncertain. Beyond this point, the studies generally\nestimated net adverse impacts that increase as GMT increases.\nUncertainties\nHow certain are we of this conclusion? There are two main considerations in assessing our\nuncertainty: how comprehensive our analysis was and how thorough the studies that we examined were.\nThe critical question is whether any uncertainties could be large enough to change our estimate of the\nshape of the curve or the increase in GMT beyond which there clearly are adverse impacts.\nThe survey found several potentially important sectors for which the relationship cannot be\ndetermined or has not been studied: we cannot determine how impacts in the water, health, and energy\nsectors change with GMT. Furthermore, there are no published studies on how global tourism and\nrecreation expenditures will change as a result of climate change. This is a large sector; 7% of the U.S.\nGDP is derived from tourism (U.S. BEA, 2002). A large reduction or increase in tourism and recreation\nexpenditures could have a substantial impact on the aggregate economic consequences of climate change.\nTourists might shift away from activities and areas adversely affected by climate change (e.g., skiing or\ncoastal areas inundated by sea level rise or impacted by cyclones) toward activities or areas made relatively\nmore favourable by climate change. There are likely to be some changes in total expenditures as well\noverall welfare derived from these activities.\nThe more difficult question to address is whether the studies that were surveyed provide a solid\nenough foundation on which to base a conclusion. Have they appropriately addressed or neglected\nimportant factors that could substantially change or even reverse the results?\nThere are a number of important sources of uncertainty underlying the estimates, and six are\naddressed below: change in variance of climate, adaptation, development, long-term temperature changes,\nchange in the climate system, and interactions among sectors.\nChange in variance of climate\nMany critics of the current generation of global impact studies point out that the bulk of these\nstudies assume a change only in average climate and do not address changes in climate variance or extreme\nevents (e.g., Schneider et al., 2000b). To be sure, changing mean conditions does capture some change in\nextreme events. For example, imposing an increase in precipitation of 10% on the historical record (which\nis done in most impact studies) increases all precipitation events by 10%. So, the wettest periods would be\n10% wetter. Furthermore, the frequency with which extreme events of a certain magnitude occur would\nincrease simply with a change in mean climate and no concomitant change in variance. But this approach\ndoes not capture potential changes in the magnitude of variance and can be particularly misleading if the\nobserved climate period used in the analysis is a relatively stable one.\nChange in variance is plausible and has already been observed to some extent. Easterling et al.\n(2000) found that extreme precipitation increased over the 20th century. Variance in the future could\nchange as well. Timmerman et al. (1999) found that El Niño conditions could become more frequent and\ninterspersed with stronger La Niñas, although the IPCC was equivocal about whether the intensity or\nfrequency of El Niño Southern Oscillations would increase. Climate models generally find that\nprecipitation intensity will continue to increase (Houghton et al., 2001).\n***END OF PAGE 87***\n\n***START OF PAGE 88***\nIt is difficult to say whether an increase in variance would reverse or amplify the overall findings\ndiscussed above. The few studies that have addressed this possibility do not provide consistent results.\nChen et al. (2001) examined how a change in ENSO as modelled by Timmerman et al. could affect U.S.\nagricultural output. The estimated impacts are negative (about $1 billion in losses), but are about an order\nof magnitude smaller than the impacts of a mean change in climate (NAST, 2000). On the other hand,\nFrederick and Schwarz (1999) found that the magnitude of economic impacts of a severe drought in the\nUnited States could be $100 billion per year. It is not clear how the drought modelled by Frederick and\nSchwartz differs from historic droughts. This level of damages is comparable to or even greater than the\ntotal potential economic gains of climate change for the United States for a limited amount of warming\n(although severe droughts are discrete events while estimates of gains from a change in long-term mean\nconditions are annual average gains sustained over long periods) (e.g., Mendelsohn and Neumann, 1999).\nAdaptation\nQuantitative impact studies make simple assumptions about adaptation. Some assume specific\nadaptations are made, such as changing planting dates or building sea walls. Others rely on spatial analogy,\nassuming that people in one location will adopt the same practices used by people in locations with\nclimates that are similar to what their future holds. The studies that assume specific adaptations probably\nunderestimate the changes people will make. Studies that rely on spatial analogy do not address the\nimpediments and costs that may be involved in adopting practices from other regions. Assumptions about\nadaptation can substantially affect results, as Rosenzweig et al. (1995) demonstrate.\nIt is difficult to know or predict exactly how affected parties will react. Smit et al. (1996) and\nWest and Dowlatabadi (1999), among others, point out the complexities involved in adaptation.\nFurthermore, it is one thing to adapt to a gradual and monotonic change in climate — it may be far more\nchallenging to adapt to a rapid change in climate or one that involves increased variance. Indeed, studies of\nadaptation to climate variance (e.g., Glantz, 1988) demonstrate that affected parties may react too quickly\nto short-term variance, neglecting the potential for reversals of climate. For example, residents of the Great\nLakes built structures closer to receding shorelines during low level periods of the early 1980s, only to\nwitness flooding of those structures as lake levels rose (Changnon, 1997).\nA realistic consideration of adaptation could lower some of the thresholds at which adverse\nimpacts are generally estimated to occur.\nDevelopment\nA critical uncertainty affecting our determination of how vulnerable systems are to climate\nchange relates to assumptions various studies make regarding development. If we impose climate change\non today’s society, vulnerability will be greater than if we assume increases in income and improvements\nin technology in the future. For example, Tol and Dowlatabadi (2002) concluded that large increases in\nincome could substantially reduce the vulnerability of people in developing countries to climate change\ninduced malaria mortality.\nSwart, 2000) all assume increased income per capita, across the globe. Will this happen? While global\nincome rose in recent decades, and some countries such as South Korea made spectacular gains in income,\nother parts of the world, such as much of Africa, have experienced no growth and even reductions in\nincome. Indeed, there may be more uncertainty about future socioeconomic conditions than about future\nclimate conditions.\n***END OF PAGE 88***\n\n***START OF PAGE 89***\nAnother key uncertainty regarding development concerns technological progress. Assumptions\nabout changes in technology can dwarf assumptions about the effects of climate change. Will past progress\ncontinue into the future, or even accelerate? This is critical in sectors such as agriculture. If the gains in\nproductivity in agriculture reaped in the last half of the 20th century continue, global production will\nincrease tremendously. There could be large surpluses, allowing sufficient cushion to absorb potential\nreductions due to climate change. Can these gains be sustained? Are there biophysical limits or other\nreasons why the gains may level off?\nIn addition, development can affect thresholds. For example, the IPCC concluded that warming\nabove 3°C will reduce crop yields (Gitay et al., 2001). This is based on current climate tolerances of crops.\nHowever, it is uncertain whether agricultural research can increase the temperature threshold that crops can\ntolerate. If it does and new cultivars are developed and diffused to farmers, agriculture may be able to\nwithstand even higher levels of climate change before production is reduced. Such considerations could\nincrease some of the thresholds at which adverse impacts are estimated to occur.\nLong-term temperature changes\nThe studies we considered examined changes in the 21st century. As Houghton et al. (2001) point\nout, it is highly likely that climate will continue changing into the 22nd century and even beyond. Even\naggressive greenhouse gas stabilisation measures will still result in long-term change in climate. Although\nthe rate of climate change will begin to slow down, additional warming thresholds will be crossed,\npotentially resulting in additional adverse impacts. Those additional impacts are not accounted for in this\nstudy, and thus the long-term consequences of different levels of increase in GMT may be underestimated.\nThis may be particularly significant for coastal resources because of the long-term inertia in the climate-\nocean system.\nChange in the climate system\nGlobal warming in the 21st century could trigger fundamental and potentially catastrophic\nchanges in the climate system that may not be realised until after the 21st century. These events might\ninclude a slowdown or complete breakdown of the thermohaline circulation, which could result in cooling\nof the North Atlantic, including Western Europe and eastern North America (Vellinga and Wood, 2002);\nmelting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet; or a runaway greenhouse effect. The magnitudes of change\nrequired to trigger catastrophic events are uncertain. Larger changes in GMT than are likely to occur in this\ncentury would be necessary to trigger many of these events. Our survey did not consider the consequences\nof such events or the probabilities of triggering them, and thus may underestimate long-term adverse\nimpacts associated with particular increases in global mean temperature.\nInteractions among sectors\nThe sectors addressed in this study are not isolated in reality. Water and agriculture are one\nexample of closely linked sectors. Decreased water supplies can limit agricultural production, while\nincreased agricultural demand for water puts more pressure on water supplies. Other sectors exhibit\nsimilarly tight links. Indeed, none of the sectors studied is unaffected by changes in any of the other\nsectors. These linkages might result in exacerbation or, in some cases, amelioration of impacts we report.\nThus, thresholds or slopes of damage curves might be higher or lower depending on these linkages.\nThe studies we considered generally did not consider linkages with nonclimate stressors. Factors\nsuch as pollution, habitat fragmentation, and population growth can increase the sensitivity of many of\n***END OF PAGE 89***\n\n***START OF PAGE 90***\nthese sectors to climate change. Depending on the sector, development can serve as an additional stressor\nor can help ameliorate climate related impacts.\nFinally, few of the studies we examined addressed whether adverse impacts across sectors might\nlead to societal disruptions such as migration or conflict (Nicholls et al., 1999, for one, assumed people\nwill migrate out of the coastal zone if there is continued flooding). It is difficult to simulate these events\nbecause they can be the result of many factors. Nonetheless, it is possible that such events might happen.\nNot considering them probably biases results toward an underestimate of impacts.\nOther issues\nOther issues important to assessing the credibility and utility of the literature reviewed in this\nstudy include the choice of metrics, temporal scales, and range of climate change addressed, and spatial\nand distributional issues. Two issues that the paper or studies we examined do not consider explicitly are\nproactive adaptation and ancillary benefits.\nUse of metrics\nThis study used metrics as reported by the authors. Those metrics are quite varied, and include\ndollars, number of people affected, change in “ecoclimatic” zone, and ecological measures such as net\necosystem productivity. Since these are distinct metrics, it is not possible to combine them without\nconverting them to a common unit. Some authors such as Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) used monetary units,\nwhile Arnell et al. (2002) primarily used number of people at risk (although they use different measures for\necosystem productivity).\nThere is no right or wrong approach when it comes to metrics (see Schneider et al., 2001, for\nmore discussion on the use of metrics). It is important that metrics be acceptable and meaningful to users\nof the information, such as policy makers. Using a common metric has the advantage of enabling analysts\nto sum sectoral results and report a total damage result. But metrics that facilitate summation may not\nalways be appropriate or meaningful for all sectors. For example, while it can provide useful information,\nrelying on willingness to pay to avoid adverse ecological impacts is controversial and may not be\nmeaningful to many readers. If such measures are not broadly acceptable or meaningful, it is not clear how\nresults can aid policy makers.\nWe believe that there is value in reporting results based on different metrics and ascertaining\nwhether the patterns of impacts are consistent or inconsistent. Where common metrics such as dollars are\nused across studies, results can be combined. Where different metrics are used, results should be displayed\nseparately. Readers will need to make their own judgements about comparability or tradeoffs that result\nfrom choice different metrics.\nThere is also value in using multiple metrics to cover the same set of impacts. Expressing all\nimpacts in terms of dollars allows for combining results across sectors. It also measures the degree of\nimpact. But such a metric effectively weights the impacts to the rich more than it does the impacts to the\npoor. Most of the world’s population lives in developing countries, but 70% of current world income is in\nOECD countries. Conversely, tallying individuals affected is more equitable, but not without\ncomplications. Someone only moderately affected by climate change counts just as much as someone\nseverely affected in this arithmetic. Equity considerations call into question whether the existence of\nwinners can offset losers.\n***END OF PAGE 90***\n\n***START OF PAGE 91***\nTemporal scales and range of climate change addressed\nThe studies reviewed vary in the time scales and range of climate change considered. Some used\nonly doubled CO2 equilibrium scenarios, assuming the climate change associated with CO2 doubling\noccurs by 2060, while others assumed it would be delayed until the end of the century. A number of\nstudies, such as those described in Arnell et al. (2002), examined different points of time in the 21st\ncentury. Other studies, such as Perez-Garcia et al. (1997, 2002) and Vörösmarty et al. (2000), examined\nimpacts in only the first half of this century.\nIt would be ideal if the studies examined a wide range of climate change consistent with the latest\nIPCC projections of 1.4 to 5.8°C of warming by 2100 (Houghton et al., 2001), but also examined potential\nimpacts early in the century. As noted above, ideal studies would also consider impacts beyond 2100. The\nstudies reviewed in this paper tended to assess a more limited range of time and climate change. This\nlimited scope makes it more difficult to address both impacts at low levels of climate change, which will\ntend to occur in the first half of the century, and impacts at higher levels of change, which will occur\nprimarily in the last half of the century. For example, while the agriculture studies addressed impacts\nassociated with a higher temperature change, in the range of 4 to 5°C, they provide less information\nconcerning smaller magnitudes of climate change.\nSpatial and distributional issues\nThis review focused on studies that estimate global impacts of climate change, to be able to draw\nconclusions from the literature on how global impacts change as a result of increased GMT. Many of these\nstudies also reported distribution of impacts, sometimes at the continental or subcontinental scale and\nsometimes at a national or even higher resolution. It was not a principal goal of this analysis to report on\nthese distributional results in a comprehensive way, though we do attempt to discuss the importance of\nseveral distributional issues. Results from some of the aggregates studies indicate that, at low magnitudes\nof climate change, impacts are likely to be mixed across regions, with some areas suffering damages and\nothers gleaning benefits. The actual magnitude of these regional aggregate results can vary quite\nconsiderably from average global impacts. At higher magnitudes of climate change, most regions tend to\nexperience net annual damages, and the regional picture is less mixed.\nThe results do show some generally consistent regional patterns. Lower latitude areas for\ninstance, and particularly their human sectors (as opposed to terrestrial ecosystems or marine productivity,\nfor example), tend to be more vulnerable to climate change than do higher latitude areas. Some of this is\nthe result of exposure and sensitivity. Lower latitude systems already have warm temperatures and can be\nadversely affected by higher temperatures, while higher latitude systems can benefit from longer growing\nseasons and higher temperatures. Much of this discrepancy, though, is the result of differences in adaptive\ncapacity. Developed countries, which tend to be in mid- and high latitudes, have a greater capacity to adapt\nto climate change than do less developed countries, which tend to be in lower latitudes (Smit and\nPilifosova, 2001). However, this is not to suggest that there might not be serious impacts to high latitude\nhuman systems as well, or that some sectors of some developing countries might not experience benefits\n(see Box 1).\nThe pattern for ecosystems is more complex. When ecosystem productivity is examined, such as\nterrestrial vegetation productivity (White et al., 1999) or marine productivity (Bopp et al., 2001), lower\nlatitude ecosystems are generally estimated to experience reduced productivity while higher latitude\nsystems are generally estimated to experience increased productivity. On the other hand, if risks to species\ndiversity are examined, high latitude and high altitude species, such as those in tundra, are often found to\nbe at substantial risk from climate change. To be sure, tropical ecosystems such as coral reefs are also at\n***END OF PAGE 91***\n\n***START OF PAGE 92***\nsubstantial risk from climate change. The point is not necessarily that temperate or high latitude\necosystems and species are at greater risk, but that the risks to them appear to be at least as great as the\nrisks to mid- and low latitude ecosystems and species.\nOne common limitation of the studies examined in this paper is that they used a single and\ntypically quantitative metric to examine impacts across many distributional scales. While application of\nsuch metrics enables researchers to examine global impacts in a consistent manner, they do not allow for\ndifferentiation based on regional differences or differences within population. For example, the studies of\nsocietal impacts drew conclusions about how sectors as a whole could be affected by climate change. They\ndid not differentiate among different classes, communities, or individuals. Indeed, vulnerability can vary\nsubstantially at these levels. In general, poor individuals are likely to be at greater risk than wealthier\nindividuals. The risk to individual communities can also vary depending on their exposure, sensitivity, and\nadaptive capacity. For the most part, the studies we examined did not distinguish between degrees of\nimpact within a population. Depending on the metric of choice, mild impacts to the many were equated\nwith severe impacts to the few, or degree of impact severity was not considered at all. Thus, these studies\ndo not convey the complexity of likely patterns of vulnerability.\nProactive adaptation\nProactive adaptations are measures undertaken deliberately, in anticipation, to reduce\nvulnerability to climate change (and typically climate variance). There are scores of potential proactive\nadaptations, and they can increase robustness of affected systems. For example, enhanced flood control\nmeasures could enable communities to withstand larger floods. Similarly, larger coastal defences can\nprovide more protection against sea level rise or coastal storms. Adaptations can also increase resilience,\nenabling systems to recover more quickly. For example, water markets transmit signals about availability\nof water supplies. During droughts, the price of water in water markets rises, encouraging consumers to\nconserve water. Enhancing the transparency with which such signals are communicated to market players\ncould be considered a form of proactive adaptation.\nIt is difficult to determine how effective proactive adaptations would be in reducing vulnerability.\nMost of the analysis of proactive adaptation is normative (see Smit and Pilofisova, 2001, for a more\ndetailed discussion of adaptation). Few analyses have been conducted on the costs and effectiveness of\nproactive adaptations. We cannot determine here if proactive adaptations could substantially shift the\nthresholds at which impacts become adverse or reduce the rate at which adverse impacts increase with\nhigher mean temperatures.\nAncillary benefits\nWhile the purpose of this paper was to characterise the relationship between change in climate\nand global impacts, there are other consequences of greenhouse gas emissions. One such important\nconsequence is that many of the activities that result in greenhouse gas emissions also result in emissions\nof more conventional pollutants. For example, burning coal can result in emissions of particulates, carbon\nmonoxide, precursors of ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides (which create acid rain and fine\nparticulates). Reducing these activities then can result in “ancillary benefits” due to the reduction of these\nconventional pollutants. The IPCC noted that reduction of some greenhouse gas emissions can result in\nimprovements in human health, reduced air pollution, more forest cover, and improved watersheds, and\nthey can even contribute to sustainable development (Metz et al., 2001).\nThe ancillary benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be substantial compared to the\nbenefits of avoiding adverse impacts of climate change (see Hourcade et al., 2001, for more discussion).\n***END OF PAGE 92***\n\n***START OF PAGE 93***\nThis is particularly the case if benefits are expressed in present value terms. Ancillary benefits will be\nrealised as soon as emission reduction measures are implemented, whereas benefits from avoided impacts\nmay take decades to be realised.\nResearch needs\nThis survey demonstrates that there are still substantial uncertainties about the global impacts of\nclimate change. Much of this uncertainty stems from three shortcomings of the current literature:\nincomplete characterisation of the relationship between GMT and impacts in many sectors, lack of\ncoverage of sensitive sectors, , and inadequate or inconsistent consideration of key factors that can\nsubstantially affect the relationship between GMT and impacts in a sector.\nIt is our opinion that, on a sectoral level, we can benefit most by improving our understanding of\nthe relationship between climate change and water resources and human health. Given the fact that\nhundreds of millions people are afflicted with climate sensitive health impacts each year and that billions\nof people lack adequate and safe water supplies, impacts on these sectors could have a dramatic effect on\nthe lives of tremendous numbers of people. Consequently, even small magnitudes of climate change could\nadversely affect many people through these sectors. On the other hand, development could substantially\nreduce the vulnerability of these sectors to climate change. To better understand the global consequences\nof climate change, it would help to clarify the relationship between climate change and these two sectors in\nparticular.\nAddressing sectors for which there are no global impact estimates is also important. Climate\nchange impacts on tourism and recreation, and amenity values, could all involve substantial monetary\nvalues. In addition, there are a number of sectors for which only some impacts have been assessed or for\nwhich there are a limited number of studies. This is particularly the case for energy and terrestrial and\nmarine ecosystems, for which there is limited information about impacts on developing countries,\nterrestrial animals and fisheries respectively.\nWe need to better understand factors such as development and its relationship to vulnerability, as\nwell as what level of adaptations we can realistically anticipate. A fundamental reason that developed\ncountries are considered to be less vulnerable to climate change than developing countries is adaptive\ncapacity, which is strongly correlated with development. It is important to understand how different\npotential development paths could affect vulnerability. In many of the sectors we examined, the degree of\nvulnerability can be substantially reduced. The ability of adaptation to ameliorate adverse effects of climate\nchange needs to be better understood. Many impact studies make simple assumptions about adaptation;\nadaptation is likely to be more complex and varied, and such studies as West and Dowlatabadi (1999) and\nSchneider et al. (2000a) point out these complexities.\nAn additional matter is how research should be done. One of the challenges of surveying the\nliterature is the difficulty of comparing studies that rely on different assumptions. The studies we surveyed\nused quite different assumptions, not only about time and level of climate change but also about population\nand level of development. Results are likely to be quite sensitive to differences in assumptions among these\nand other important variables. While it is beneficial to encourage creativity and experimentation in study\ndesign, there is also value in the use of common assumptions. Having at least some commonality in time\nframes, GCMs (or other sources of climate change scenarios), and socioeconomic assumptions (as was\ndone by Parry and Livermore, 1999) makes it more feasible to compare different studies. Studies being\nconducted to address the kind of questions we address in this paper ought to rely on a set of somewhat\ncommon assumptions so as to better enable users to compare results across the studies.\n***END OF PAGE 93***\n\n***START OF PAGE 94***\n13. CONCLUSIONS\nThis review examined studies of global impacts of climate change to assess whether there are\ncommon relationships between increases in global mean temperature, an indicator of the magnitude of\nclimate change, and the impacts they reported. The studies addressed most of the important societal and\nnatural sectors that are sensitive to climate. However, in some key sectors, such as recreation, tourism, and\nenergy, there has been little research conducted that characterises the relationship between climate change\nand impacts at a global scale.\nThe studies employed different metrics to measure impacts, ranging from dollars to number of\npeople affected to net ecosystem productivity to number of nature reserves affected. Since metrics differ,\nresults cannot be combined in a simple manner. Analysts can form their own interpretations or undertake\ntheir own transformations to create a common metric, but such calculations can involve a fair amount of\njudgement on the part of the analyst.\nMany of the studies made assumptions about changes in baseline socioeconomic conditions,\nadaptation, and biophysical processes. However, these assumptions are often simplifications of what is\nlikely to happen and, therefore, can introduce biases. The biases are not consistent across the studies; some\nbias the results toward estimating more adverse impacts while others bias results toward estimating more\nbenefits. In addition, a number of studies did not address key factors that could have a substantial impact\non results. Almost none of the studies addressed changes in extreme weather or state changes in climate\nsuch as an enhanced El Niño/Southern Oscillation, slowdown of the thermohaline circulation, or rapid\nmelting of glaciers.\nFew of the studies examined a range of changes in global mean temperature as wide as that of the\nlatest projections of the IPCC, which have global mean temperature rising 1.4 to 5.8°C. All of the studies\nexamined temperature increases within those limits, but their individual ranges were more narrow.\nWe examined patterns of the relationships between climate change and impacts across sectors to\nsee if there are consistent results. Almost all of the studies we examined estimated that there will be\nincreasing adverse impacts beyond an approximate 3 to 4°C increase in global mean temperature. The\nstudies do not show a consistent relationship between impacts and global mean temperatures between 0\nand 3 to 4°C. In some sectors (biodiversity and coastal resources) it is clear that impacts will be adverse\nwith low levels of temperature change. Although in other cases (health and marine productivity) the studies\nare inconclusive or do not cover this low range, we believe adverse impacts at low levels of temperature\nchange would be likely. In general, some studies show consistently increasing adverse impacts across a\nwide range of temperatures, some show a parabolic relationship (initial benefits followed by adverse\nimpacts), and some are inconclusive. Finally, aggregate studies do not show a consistent relationship with\nGMT.\nWhile there is consistency among these studies to the extent that, at some level of climate change,\nglobal impacts clearly become negative, there is uncertainty about where this threshold lies. The studies\ndid not consider changes in variance of climate, rapid changes in climate, or consequences beyond the 21st\n***END OF PAGE 94***\n\n***START OF PAGE 95***\ncentury. In addition, a number of key sectors, such as tourism and recreation, have received almost no\nattention in the literature to date, and other key sectors, in particular water resources and human health,\nhave not received the level of attention necessary to ascertain the relationship between GMT and global\nimpacts. There could be substantial adverse impacts at a few degrees of warming in these sectors, but the\ncurrent state of the literature does not allow us to make such a claim. Conversely, development and\ntechnological progress could raise thresholds for adverse impacts or reduce the slope of some of the\ndamage curves.\nThe studies found significant variation of impacts at the regional scale. Generally, lower latitude\nand developing countries face more negative effects than higher latitude and developed countries. There\nare exceptions to this assertion. One example is biodiversity, where high latitude areas are at substantial\nrisk of losing diversity. While the global studies differentiated among impacts at the regional scale, the\nregional results were still reported as aggregate results. Impacts that may differ at finer geographic scales\nor by socioeconomic groups were typically not reported.\nUnderstanding the relationship between global mean temperature and impacts is important to be\nable to understand the incremental impacts associated with varying levels of climate change. Conversely, it\nis important to understand this relationship to better understand the incremental benefits associated with\ngreenhouse gas mitigation efforts.\nFinally, comprehensive examination of global impacts, and by extension incremental benefits of\ncontrol, is one way, but not the only way, to establish a basis for mitigating climate change. Loss of\nbiodiversity, unique biomes, small island states, and other irreplaceable features of our world may justify\nsubstantial effort to limit the extent of climate change. The expectation of adverse impacts of large enough\nmagnitude in a given sector or region may provide a rationale for action. Similarly, triggering of state\nchanges in climate may also be deemed unacceptable. However, the goal for analysts continues to be\nlaying out and assimilating information that decision makers can use in addressing this critical matter.\n***END OF PAGE 95***\n\n***START OF PAGE 96***\nREFERENCES\nAlcamo, J., P.
