Tehran received massive dip-\nlomatic pressure from other governments and\ncondemnation from media around the world\nto put an end to the post-election violence.\nAround the world, social media are\nbecoming commonplace tools for political and\nsocial activism. If military leaders do not fully\nunderstand these tools, they may miss their\nsignificant impact on the nature of future\nconflicts. America’s potential enemies are\nusing these technologies now to enhance their\nefforts. The U.S. military can either engage\nin the social media environment seriously or\ncede this ground to the enemy.3 The develop-\nment of strategies to account for the impact of\nsocial media will be one of the keys to success\nin future operations.\nThe germane question to ask is: How\ncan an effective social media strategy have\nan impact on the outcomes of military\noperations? A recent Military Review article\ndescribed the use of new media tools in\nthe second Lebanon War involving Israeli\nforces and Hizballah in 2006.4 The article\ncontrasted that with Operation Cast Lead,\nwhen Israeli forces attacked the Gaza Strip\nin December 2008 and January 2009. The\ndiffering approaches taken by Israeli forces in\nthe two operations highlight how an effective\nnew media strategy can impact the strategic\noutcomes.\nIn the summer of 2006, Hizballah\neffectively integrated information operations,\nincluding social media, into their tactical\noperations to fight the Israelis. Hizballah\nembedded photos and videos into blogs and\nYouTube to promote a positive self-image and\nto highlight negative perceptions of Israeli\noperations. Hizballah used information effec-\ntively to limit Israel’s strategic options. After\n33 days of fighting, a ceasefire was declared\nand Hizballah claimed victory. The organiza-\ntion was able to create a “perception of failure”\nfor Israel, which ignored the realities of the\nnew media and relied instead on traditional\ninformation policies. It was less agile than\nHizballah and was unable to match the group\nin the information war. In contrast, in Opera-\ntion Cast Lead, Israeli forces devised a more\neffective strategy for the use of social and new\nmedia. They developed a proactive informa-\ntion strategy, incorporating social media tools,\nalong with enlisting the support of the Israeli\nonline communities, to set the agenda in the\nmedia and control perceptions of the fighting.\nThe result was that the Israelis used informa-\ntion effectively to preserve strategic options\nenabling them to achieve their objectives.5\nthe Ends\nThe strategic framework used by the\nU.S. Army War College defines a strategy\nas the relationship among ends, ways, and\nmeans. To develop a strategy, we must first\nhave objectives or ends in mind. The ends are\ngoals sought by the commander devising the\nstrategy.6 With respect to social media, what\nare some of the ends a commander might have\nin mind?\nPerhaps the first end that command-\ners should have in mind when determining\ntheir strategy is a better understanding of the\nenvironment, or better situational awareness\nthrough an effective use of social media. By\nsystematically observing the online commu-\nnity in the area of responsibility (AOR), com-\nmanders may be able to develop an ongoing\nunderstanding of the society in question, as\nwell as its concerns and interests, and the\ncommanders may be able to identify emerg-\ning trends and patterns. Blogs and social\nnetworking sites could provide insight to any\nsociety where there is a significant online\ncommunity, particularly in societies with a\nrelatively young population. The Department\nof State has effectively used social networking\nsites to gauge the sentiments within societies.\nU.S. Embassies in many nations are effectively\nusing Facebook and other social media tools\nin places such as Podgorica, Damascus,\nPhnom Penh, and Panama to maintain rela-\ntionships with the local cultures, particularly\nwith the youth who are more likely to engage\nusing social media.7\nMaintaining a social media presence in\ndeployed locations also allows commanders\nto understand potential threats and emerg-\ning trends within their AORs. The online\ncommunity can provide a good indicator of\nprevailing moods and emerging issues. Many\nof the vocal opposition groups will likely use\nsocial media to air grievances publicly. In the\nfall of 2008, General David Petraeus wrote\nan article for Military Review entitled “Multi-\nNational Force–Iraq Commander’s Counter-\ninsurgency Guidance” in which he lists key\ntasks for his commanders in Iraq.8 While the\ntasks listed are intended for fighting the insur-\ngency in Iraq, many of them are universally\napplicable. For example, he asserts that it is\nimportant for commanders to “[u]nderstand\nthe neighborhood” and “[l]ive among the\npeople.” An online social media presence\ncan be an integral part of understanding the\nissues and attitudes in a neighborhood or\ncommunity. An online presence can play a\nmajor role in living among the people in a\nsociety that has a significant online commu-\nnity. Social media would certainly not be the\nonly tool used by commanders; however, they\ncould enable the commanders to understand\nenvironments and allow them to have better\nsituational awareness of these environments.\nA second desired end for social media\nin a theater of operations may be to assist the\ncommand in providing better, more agile,\nand more credible public information in the\nAOR (both strategic communications and\nlocal/tactical information). As demonstrated\nin the example above of the Israel Defense\nForces, aggressive engagement in the social\nmedia environment can aid a commander\nin winning the information fight. General\nPetraeus’s guidance emphasizes the impor-\ntance of several related tasks.

That is to say, social media\nshould have the support and interest of the\ncommander and key members of his staff and\nshould be formalized into a program with\nresponsibilities assigned to members of the\ncommander’s staff. The commander should\nview social media as an asset rather than\na threat. Social media planning should be\nincorporated across the spectrum of conflict.\nThe commander should state his intent for\ninformation effects, explicitly noting the role\nsocial media should play. That allows his staff\nto generate options much the same way as is\ndone for other combat multipliers. A proactive\nengagement with social media incorporated\ninto the commander’s operational planning\nwould likely provide the best results.\nThere will certainly be skeptics about\nthe need for a command social media\nprogram. In an article linked to the Depart-\nment of State’s Social Media Hub, entitled\n“Eight Ways to Ruin Your Social Media\nStrategy,” mistake number one is to “Pretend\nyou can do without it.”12 As seen in the case of\nthe Israel Defense Forces’ experience, ignoring\nnew media is done at our own peril.\nA second way to take advantage of social\nmedia is to organize the social media program\nfor success. The U.S. military has experi-\nmented with ways of organizing for success\nin strategic communication (SC) for the last\nfew years. The experience gained in organiz-\ning for strategic communication may provide\nsome insight into organizing for social media\nsuccess as well. The Joint Warfighting Center\nCommander’s Handbook for Strategic Com-\nmunication lays out five models that have been\nused for organizing SC. The options include:\n■■ increasing command emphasis (least\ncostly)\n■■ tasking an existing staff leader/section\n■■ integrating a direct planning team\n■■ centralizing control of all SC-related\nactivities under a separate directorate (most\ncostly)\n■■ having an SC director with a small coor-\ndinating staff and supporting working group.\nThe final option has gained the most\ntraction in the field, with several combatant\ncommands adopting a similar structure.13\nThat option provides the ability to incorporate\nthe best attributes of the other options and\nmaintain an appropriate level of command\nemphasis on the SC program. While com-\nmanders may choose to employ a similar\nmethodology for social media, integration\nof social media planning into an existing\nSC structure may also be an effective way to\nensure success. Commanders will have to\nweigh the costs with the potential benefits in\ntheir particular situation.\nThe natural reaction of many com-\nmanders may be to assign one staff section as\nthe proponent for social media, leaving the\nresponsibility for integration to them. While\nthat approach may be easier to implement\nthan some of the other options, the risk is the\nsocial media program will become viewed as a\nniche program and will not get the attention it\nFacebook page supporting\nIDF Operation Cast Lead\nISAF–NATO Facebook page\n***END OF PAGE 3***","title":"ndupress nduedu  issue   st quarter   JFQ","slideNum":3,"paragraph":"***START OF PAGE 3***\nndupress .ndu.edu  issue 60, 1 st quarter 2011 / JFQ    81\nMAYfIELD\nmedia program can play a key role in accom-\nplishing these tasks.

The experience gained in organiz-\ning for strategic communication may provide\nsome insight into organizing for social media\nsuccess as well. The Joint Warfighting Center\nCommander’s Handbook for Strategic Com-\nmunication lays out five models that have been\nused for organizing SC. The options include:\n■■ increasing command emphasis (least\ncostly)\n■■ tasking an existing staff leader/section\n■■ integrating a direct planning team\n■■ centralizing control of all SC-related\nactivities under a separate directorate (most\ncostly)\n■■ having an SC director with a small coor-\ndinating staff and supporting working group.\nThe final option has gained the most\ntraction in the field, with several combatant\ncommands adopting a similar structure.13\nThat option provides the ability to incorporate\nthe best attributes of the other options and\nmaintain an appropriate level of command\nemphasis on the SC program. While com-\nmanders may choose to employ a similar\nmethodology for social media, integration\nof social media planning into an existing\nSC structure may also be an effective way to\nensure success. Commanders will have to\nweigh the costs with the potential benefits in\ntheir particular situation.\nThe natural reaction of many com-\nmanders may be to assign one staff section as\nthe proponent for social media, leaving the\nresponsibility for integration to them. While\nthat approach may be easier to implement\nthan some of the other options, the risk is the\nsocial media program will become viewed as a\nniche program and will not get the attention it\nFacebook page supporting\nIDF Operation Cast Lead\nISAF–NATO Facebook page\n***END OF PAGE 3***","image":[],"pageNum":3},{"SlideNum":4,"PageNum":4,"Title":"JFQ  issue   st quarter  ndupress nduedu","Paragraph":"***START OF PAGE 4***\n82    JFQ / issue 60, 1 st quarter 2011 ndupress .ndu.edu\nCOMMENTARY | A Commander’s Strategy for Social Media\nmight deserve. Furthermore, the social media\nprogram would assume the natural biases of\nthe assigned staff element, decreasing its broad\neffectiveness. For example, if J6 (Command,\nControl, Communications, and Computer\nSystems staff section) were the proponent,\nit might input a technical bias, and likewise\nthe Public Affairs (PA) section might tend\nto approach social media as an outreach tool\nonly. Thus, broad integration may provide the\nbest opportunity to achieve the results desired.\nThe third way to benefit from social\nmedia is to create a social media monitoring\nteam to act as the eyes and ears of the strat-\negy team. Team members may be viewed as\n“social media scouts,” observing, monitoring,\nand collecting information on the state of the\nonline community in the AOR. The monitor-\ning team represents a systematic way to take\nadvantage of the content and trends in the\nsocial media. Without a systematic approach,\nthere may be little chance of making accurate\nobservations and drawing the correct conclu-\nsions from the online traffic in the AOR. If\nevery staff section were to independently\nmonitor Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or the\nlocal language versions of social networks and\nblogs, without lateral coordination within the\nstaff, there will likely be significant gaps in the\nmonitoring of the social media environment.\nThe monitoring team should contain\nbroad staff representation to be effective.\nThe team will require members with local\nlanguage skills, cultural understanding, and\na high degree of familiarity with the social\nmedia tools and protocols. To be effective,\nthey will need to conduct field research in\nthe AOR. They will also need to observe the\nInternet cafes and local habits in the AOR and\nbecome familiar with the social media plat-\nforms popular in the culture.\nThe fourth way to ensure success in\na social media strategy is to find a balance\nbetween security and sharing. The informa-\ntion security concerns over experimentation\nof social software on Department of Defense\n(DOD) computers are not trivial. Security\nofficers will be inclined to say no to extensive\nuse of social media on networks that are used\nfor official purposes.14 There is considerable\ndiscussion within DOD on this issue. The\nServices have significant disagreement on\nthe right level of access to allow, balanced\nagainst the need for security. The DOD\npolicy released on February 25, 2010, directs\nthat “the NIPRNET [unclassified networks]\nshall be configured to provide access to\nInternet-based capabilities across all DoD\nComponents.”15 The policy goes on to give the\ncomponents significant latitude to limit access\nto defend against malicious activity when\nneeded. There may be ways of using firewalls\nor separated networks to ensure security of\ninformation while still benefiting from the\nuse of social media. Each command will have\nto weigh this balance and make the decision\nbased on its needs.\nSince speed and agility are key elements\nof successful social media strategy, the fifth\nway to enhance success in a strategy is to enact\npolicies to allow the social media campaign\nto be agile. Restrictive and cumbersome\napproval chains may inhibit the ability of the\noperators to achieve results. Perhaps the best\napproach is to allow for centralized planning\nand decentralized execution.16 The enemy will\nnot be constrained from posting information\nto the Internet by a cumbersome approval\nprocess and thus has the ability to act very\nquickly. Operation Valhalla in Iraq in 2006\nprovides an illustrative example.\nDuring a successful firefight against\nthe Jaish al-Mahdi (JAM) forces, U.S. Special\nForces and Iraqi forces killed a number\nof enemy fighters, rescued a hostage, and\ndestroyed a weapons cache—by all measures,\na very successful operation. By the time\nU.S. and Iraqi forces returned to their base,\nsomeone had repositioned the bodies and\nremoved the weapons of the JAM fighters\nso it looked like they were murdered while\nat prayer. They photographed the bodies in\nthese new poses and uploaded the images\nonto the Internet, along with a press release\nexplaining that American Soldiers killed the\nmen while they were in a mosque. All this\ntook the enemy less than an hour. The public\nreaction was predictably negative. The U.S.\nforces had a combat camera crew with them\nduring the operation, and some of the Soldiers\nwore helmet cameras. U.S. forces were in pos-\nsession of the evidence to disprove the claims,\nbut a cumbersome and highly centralized\nprocess for releasing information prevented\nthe correct story from reaching the media for\nnearly 3 days. By the time U.S. forces released\nthe correct version of Operation Valhalla, the\nstrategic damage was done.17 The inability\nto react immediately to the enemy claims in\nthe previous example was largely for policy\nreasons. To promote agility, the U.S. military’s\npolicies must allow for decentralized execu-\ntion of operations involving new media.\nDecentralization of execution, however,\nmay force commanders to accept levels of\nrisk with which they may not be comfortable.\nThe commander will essentially delegate the\ncontrol of information releasing authority to\nlow levels. Clear rules of engagement distrib-\nuted to all the potential social media operators\nmay be able to mitigate the risks. The need\nfor agility will often conflict with the need to\ncarefully control the strategic message.18\nOne of the key elements for command-\ners to enhance agility in their social media\nprogram is to allow and encourage social\nmedia operations to be executed even at the\nlowest unit level. Many of the closest relation-\nships established in an AOR are formed at\nbattalion level and below. Local government\nleaders, tribal leaders, police, and militias are\nall developing relationships at the very lowest\nlevels. The leaders at these units will know\nhow best to interface with the population.\nWeb sites, blogs, and links to Facebook pages\ncan be used for nearby activities.

Combined arms prowess and\neffective restraint both belong in the doctrinal\ntoolbox.\nSo the principles in FM 3–24 showed\nstrongly in insurgencies worldwide over the\npast 30 years, not just ambiguously in wars\nof independence more than 40 years ago, as\nColonel Gentile argued. While the details of\nFM 3–24, like all doctrine, should be subjected\nto continuing scrutiny and refinement based\non operational experience, there appear to be\nno grounds in the past 30 years of insurgency\nworldwide for any attack on the core princi-\nples of FM 3–24. Similarly, firepower need not\nbe wholly eschewed in COIN, but the record\nof history suggests that victory over the long\nterm is much more likely to go to those who\nare judicious in their application of force.
