So far it is not clear why the pine trees turn wilting,\nthough several hypotheses about the pathogenic mechanism of pine wilt disease have been presented,\nsuch as phytotoxins causing death of pine trees; cellulases hydrolyzing celluloses of pine tree;\nterpenoids causing cavitation and water column breakage of pine tree, etc. Recently, it was found that\ncertain bacteria, symbiotically associated with the pinewood nematode, may play some roles in the\npathogenicity of the disease. Since the pine wilt disease is a complex interrelationships among beetle,\npine tree, fungi, bacterium and nematode, all the pathogenic factors are not mutually exclusive, which\nmeans a variety of factors make pine tree for death, rather than a single factor. Pinewood nematode and\nbacteria produce phytotoxins and cellulases, which cause the defense of pine tree and stimulate the\nproduction of terpenoids to form cavitation, break water columns and finally make pine trees wilting.\nPinewood nematode is involved in the production of phytotoxins, cellulases and terpenoids; therefore it\nis a vital and indispensable factor for pine wilting disease.\nKey words: Pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, pathogenic mechanism, terpenoid, cavitation,\ncellulase, phytotoxin, bacteria.\nINTRODUCTION\nPine wilt is a disease of pine (pinus spp.) caused by the\npinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.\nPWN is native to North America and is not considered as\na primary pathogen of native pines, but is the cause\nagent of pine wilt for some non-native pines. Although the\nfirst occurrence of pine wilt disease (PWD) was reported\nin 1905 in Nagasaki City, Japan (Yano, 1935), PWN was\nnot identified as the causal agent of the disease until\n1971 (Mamiya and Kiyohara, 1972). So far PWD has\nbeen reported from North America (Canada, the United\nStates and Mexico), East Asia (Japan, Korea and China)\nand Europe (Portugal) (Yano, 1913; Cheng, 1983; Tzean\nand Jan, 1985; Guiran and Bruguir, 1989; Yi et al.,  1989;\n*Corresponding author. E-mail: kchsung@cnu.ac.kr. Tel: +82-\nDwinell, 1993; Mota et al., 1999). It has become a world-\nwide threat to pine forests and forest ecosystem with\ngreat economic losses. In 2003, this disease had killed\nabout 1,000,000 m3 of pine trees in Japan (Forestry\nagency, 2004).\nHowever, until now the pathogenic mechanism of PWD\nhas not been clearly illustrated. For a long time, it was\nthought that the PWN was the only pathogenic agent\ncausing the disease (Mamiya, 1975; Nickle et al., 1981;\nNobuchi et al., 1984; Fukuda et al., 1992), to be exactly,\nphytotoxins, cellulases, which are produced by PWN,\nethylene and terpenoids produced by pine trees which\nare stimulated by invasion of PWN. Recently, it was found\nthat some bacteria are symbiotically associated with the\nPWNs and may play some roles in the pathogenicity of\nthe disease (Oku et al., 1979; Kawazu, 1998; Han et al.,\n2003; Zhao et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2005). In order to be\nsure of the real cause of  pine  wilt  disease,  some  hypo-\n***END OF PAGE 1***\n\n***START OF PAGE 2***\n438      Afr.   J.    Microbiol.   Res.\ntheses were introduced and discussed in this paper.\nPHYTOTOXIN HYPOTHESIS\nDuring the 70s and 80s of the 20th century, some scien-\ntists considered that phytotoxins which was isolated from\ninfected pine trees or from B. xylophilus can directly\ncause wilt symptoms. Oku et al. (1979) found that the\nfiltrate of pine leaf juice in which the pathogenic nema-\ntodes were infected could cause wilting of the seedlings,\nboiled extract of pine wood also contained toxin product.\nSubsequently, some chemical compound such as\nbenzoic acid, catechol, dihydroconifery alcohol, 8-\nhydroxycarvotanacetone (carbone hydrate) and 10-\ndydroxyverbenone were isolated from infected PWN pine\ntrees and could cause wilt symptoms of susceptible pine\ntrees (Oku, 1979). Among them, 8-hydroxycarvotanace-\ntone, dihydroconifery alcohol and 10-dydroxyverbenone\ncould inhibit the reproduction of B. xylophilus. Shaheen\n(1984) also got a similar conclusion that the phytotoxins,\nwhich were lipid materials with low molecular weight and\nisolated from B. xylophilus infected scots pine, caused\nwilting of 45-day-old and 2-year-old pine seedlings in a\ncertain dose.\nHowever, Kozlowski (1962, 1968) held a contrary\nopinion that PWD kills tree by interfering with water trans-\nlocation rather than immediate and direct toxic effects.\nCao and Shen (1996) studied the toxicity of extraction of\nPWN, which was cultured on an artificial medium and\nfound that nematode extraction was not toxic to 30-day-\nold seedlings of Pinus thunbergii and Pinus massoniana.\nThey concluded that wilt toxins were not produced by\nPWN under artificial culture conditions. In addition, some\nscientists hold the alternate opinion that bacteria asso-\nciated with the PWN produce toxin (Kawazu, 1998; Han\net al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2003).\nCELLULASE HYPOTHESIS\nCellulases were detected by the analysis of the homo-\ngenates and extracts of the nematode species in more\nthan ten genera, including the genus Bursaphelenchus\n(Tracey, 1958; Krusberg, 1960; Dropkin et al., 1962;\nMorgan and Mcallan, 1962; Dropkin, 1963; OdaniI et al.,\n1985). Cellulases were exuded outside of PWN and left in\nPWN migrating track which were detected by Yamanoto\n(1986). After that he collected 9.8×106 B. xylophilus in 10\nml of distilled water. And then 0.5 ml of the supernatant of\nthis suspension was filtered and injected to pine seed-\nlings. No complete necrosis of the needles was observed\nin the seedlings, but sporadic distribution of the necrotic\nneedles was observed. Close observations of pine\ntissues infected with B. xylophilus indicated that the\ndestruction of pine cells might be a result of cell wall\ndegrading enzymes such as cellulase (Ishida et al., 1997;\nIchihara et al., 2000).\nFeeding of 0.5 ml 1% solution of cellulase Onozuka R-\n10 (Kinki Yakult) to 3-year-old P. densiflora seedlings\nresulted in a complete necrosis of living shoots less than\n72 h. Other symptoms such as oleoresin leaks and partial\nblocking of xylem water conduction were also reproduced\nby feeding seedlings the crude or high molecular weight\nfractions of the extracts of the PWN. Therefore Odani et\nal. (1985) thought that cellulase produced by the PWN is\nresponsible for the development of the early symptom\nand is a strong candidate of the pathogen. The glycosyl\nhydrolase family have been isolated from the B.\nxylophilus and characterized (Kikuchi, 2004). In 45 kinds\nof cellulases, Bx-ENG-1, 2 and 3 could be secreted\nthrough the nematode stylet into plant tissues and\nparticipate in the weakening of the cell walls, allowing\nnematodes to feed and migrate more easily in pine\ntissues. From total homogenates of B. xylophilus, Zhang\n(2006) found a high molecular weight cellulase antigen,\nwhich was able to hydrolyze carboxymethyl cellulose effi-\nciently (155.65 U/mg) and had an approximate molecular\nmass of 58.9 kDa. The style of secreting cellulase from\nthe stylet and using hydrolyze cellulase to facilitate the\nPWN entering host cells is consistent with other plant\nparasitical nematodes. Moreover, strong fluorescence\nsignals from cellulase staining were observed in tracheid\ncells which were naturally infected by PWN, in addition to\nray cells and the resin canal zone (Zhang, 2006).\nThese results support that the nematode–originated\ncellulase is one of the strong candidate of the pathogenic\nsubstances responsible for the development of the pine\nwilt disease. It is also reported that endoglucanases used\nby the nematode to degrade the cell walls of fungi on\nwhich it feeds as cellulose, as well as chitin and other\npolysaccharides, have been shown to be present in the\nwalls of some of the fungi on which B. xylophilus feed\n(Cherif et al., 1993).\nTERPENOID HYPOTHESIS\nKuroda et al. (1988) proposed that the ultimate death of\npine tree is due to water deficit induced by extensive ca-\nvitation of sapwood. The pathway of water movement in a\ntree is via a bundle of capillary water columns. Once any\nbreaks in the water column disrupt water flow, water\nconduction of xylem tracheids could be impeded due to\nembolism. Embolized tracheids are filled with air, re-\nsulting from cavitation produced by the breakage of water\ncolumns in xylem conduits (Ikeda, 1992). By using the\nacoustic emission technique, Ikeda approved that the\noccurrence of cavitation events in Japanese black pine\ngrowing under field conditions is comparatively rare, even\nin summer. Based on the results, it seemed that xylem\ncavitation is caused by pathogenic factor, not by culti-\nvation condition. Cavitation of tracheids is a remarkable\ninitial symptom of PWD caused  by  the  PWN  (Kiyohara,\n***END OF PAGE 2***\n\n***START OF PAGE 3***\nWang  et al.    439\nFigure 1. Spin–echo T1–weighted magnetic resonance images (transverse–slice) of inoculated seedling\nfrom 1 to 25 days after inoculation. Cavitated xylem appears as dark patches. Repetition time (TR) =500\nms, echo time (TE) = 22 ms, 256 × 256 pixels. Stem diameter 9 mm. Reproduced from Utsuzawa SK\n1990). By observation Kuroda (1992) found that xylem\nwater–blockage caused by cavitation started one week\nafter nematode inoculation.\nKuroda (1989) found that parenchyma cells, which\nwere injured by moving and feeding of nematode, syn-\nthesized terpenoids. Seven monoterpenes from infected\npine trees: \u0001–pinene, \u0000 camphene, \u0002–pinene, myrcene,\nlimonene, \u0002–phellandrene, and p–cymene, were detec-\nted. Volatile terpenoids evaporated in tracheids under\nnegative pressure and made bubble. Refilling of cavitated\ntracheids with water was prevented by hydrophobic\neffects of terpenoids, therefore, permanent cavitation\nenlarged gradually. Consequently, cavitated areas\nreached to cambium, water translation was broke, finally\npine trees died due to the water deficit.\nEthylene acts as a signal transduction material to\ncause terpenoid produce in pine trees, experiments asso-\nciated with ethylen have been done. Ethylene product\nwas inoculated into seedlings which increased several\ntimes greater in the disease development which began a\nfew days earlier than the water potential decrease and\nchlorosis in needles. Ethylene increase occurred syn-\nchronously with cambial death, and they were followed by\nwater deficiency in leaves. After being injected with 0.1–\n1% ethrel (2–chlorophenylphosphonic acid) solution to\nseedlings, embolism in tracheids widely occurred and\nneedles turned yellow quickly. A large embolized area\nwas produced in xylem both above and below the\ninjection site. Some days later it developed to almost the\nwhole transverse area of the xylem. Furthermore,\ndenaturation of xylem and cortex parenchyma cells were\nproduced. Ethylene produced in xylem seems to trigger\nthe cytological changes in xylem parenchymatous cell,\nembolism  in  tracheids  and   chlorosis   of   old   needles\n(Fukuda, 1997).\nUtsuzawa (2005) has observed the xylem cavitation\ncaused by PWD by using the magnetic resonance for\nliving trees, rather than by staining part of tree xylem\nwhich have to be sectioned. Through the nondestructive\nobservation, he found that cavitaiton was limited to the\ninner xylem for about 10 days after infection, and the\nnumber of cavitated patches and the area of cavitation\nslowly increased. After 15 days, the cavitation area\nenlarged rapidly and reached the cambium, and at 21\ndays the relative area of cavitaion reached near 100%.\nWater conduction was completely dysfunction and the\ntree became wilting and dead (Figure 1). According to the\nsymptoms, the development of pine wilt disease was\ndivided into two stages: early and advanced stage\n(Fukuda, 1997). In the early stage, nematodes migrate\nthrough cortical and xylem resin canals in pine stems.\nThey induce cavitation (breaking off the water column in\ntracheids), embolism (filling of the tracheids with gas) and\nocclusion of the tracheids with resin; in transverse\nsections of the stem, the affected tissues appear as dry\npatches. In the advanced stage, the nematodes multiply\nand destroy the cambium, which induces dysfunction of\nwater conduction in the entire xylem and causes water\npotential, transpiration, and photosynthesis to rapidly\ndecrease. Consequently, the needles wilt and the tree\ndies suddenly. The first stage is within 7 to 14 days and\nthe advanced stage is during 15 to 30 days (Figure 2).\nPWN AND BACTERIA HYPOTHESES\nThe bacteria carried by the PWN play an important role in\npathogenicity of PWD. Oku et al. (1980) and Higgins et\nal.  (1999) reported  that  bacteria  were  associated   with\n***END OF PAGE 3***\n\n***START OF PAGE 4***\n440      Afr.   J.    Microbiol.   Res.\nFigure 2.

Image data are\nmissing from seedling 2 on days 0, 1, 13, and 14. Solid and open arrows indicate the days when\nyellowing of old needles and wilting of current needles, respectively, were first observed. Reproduced\nfrom Utsuzawa SK (2005).\nPWN. Bacteria adhered onto the body wall of PWN was\nobserved by using electron microscopy and the average\nnumber of bacteria carried by one nematode isolated\nfrom infected pine tree was 2.9×102 (Zhao et al., 2000;\nGuo et al., 2002).\nSome experiments indicated that aseptic PWN does\nnot cause PWD of aseptic pine trees, while PWN asso-\nciated with infecting bacterium causes wilting symptom.\nOku et al. (1980) inoculated 3-year-old seedlings with a\nsuspension of bacterium of the genus Pseudomonas\nisolated from pathogenic PWN. Three out of five of the\ntreated seedlings subsequently wilted. Kawazu and\nKaneko (1997) and Chi et al. (2006) reported aseptic\nPseudomonas densiflora seedlings and 10-year-old\nPseudomonas thunbegii trees did not wilt after being\ninoculated with aseptic PWN. Tan et al. (2004) reported\nthat 1– or 2–year–old branches of Pseudomonas\nmassoniana were inoculated with aseptic B. xylophilus\nand bacterium Bacillus firmus turned diseased. Therefore\nPWN associated with bacteria plays a significant role in\nthe rapid wilting of pine trees.\nInoculating callus and aseptic black pine seedlings with\naseptic PWN and the bacteria which isolated from PWN\nin the genus Pseudomonas showed severe symptoms,\nbut only inoculating with aseptic PWN did not lead to\nbrowning (Han et al., 2003). In addition, the filtered liquid\nwhich bacteria were cultured in was directly applied to the\ncallus of Japanese black pine induce browning. Han et al.\n(2003) and Zhao et al. (2003) concluded that  wilting  was\ndue to toxins in the bacterial culture filtrate. Jiang et al.\n(2005) and Guo et al. (2007) isolated two chemical\ncompounds, which showed obvious toxicity to both\nsuspension cells and seedlings of P. thunbergii, from the\nculture of a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens (P.\nfluorescens GcM5–1A) carried by PWN. The bacteria\ncarried by PWN from isolated regions may be different.\nSuch differences could explain why Cedrus deodara is\nsensitive to PWD in USA and Japan (Dropkin, 1981),\nwhile it is resistant in China (Zhao, 2003). It suggested\nthat the disease was caused by co-infection of both PWN\nand bacteria and possible toxic effect of bacteria (Han,\nGuo et al. (2006) reported that both the homogenates\nfrom live PWN and dead nematodes promoted the repro-\nduction and pathogenicity of the bacterium by providing\nessential metabolites or nutrients, and that the promotion\neffect of living nematodal homogenates was stronger\nthan that of dead ones. Furthermore, Zhao (2005) found\nthat there is a mutualistic symbiotic relationship between\nPWN and 10 bacterial species in the genus\nPseudomonas. The bacterial mutualistic symbionts are\norganized whole, which may have co-evolved with PWN\nrather than being accidentally associated. The finding\nprovides that PWD is a complex process, induced by\nboth PWN and associated phytotoxin-producing bacteria.\nHowever, migration speed of PWN and bacteria is\ndifferent, so how do the bacteria produce enough toxins\nto make pine tree wilting before its mass rearing  need  to\n***END OF PAGE 4***\n\n***START OF PAGE 5***\nbe researched.\nDISCUSSION\nPhytotoxins and cellulases produced by PWN, such as\nbenzoic acid, catechol, dihydroconifery alcohol, 8-\nhydroxycarvotanacetone (carbone hydrate), 10–\ndydroxyverbenone and glycosyl hydrolase family, could\ncause dysfunction of pine trees in some degree and wilt\nsymptoms of susceptible pine trees, even death. It needs\na large number of PWN to produce enough quantity of\nphytotoxins and cellulases to cause wilt symptoms of\npine trees. Consequently, the bigger pine trees should\nsuffer more PWN and longer time to cause disease than\nsmaller ones and the bigger pine trees survive longer\ntime than smaller ones. However, infact the bigger pine\ntrees show wilt symptoms earlier than small pine trees.\nPhytotoxin hypothesis and cellulase hypothesis could not\nexplain the phenomenon adequately.\nTerpenoid hypothesis explained how PWN causes\ndysfunction of water translocation of pine trees. Migrating\nof Nematodes through cortical and xylem resin canals in\npine stems induces cavitation, embolism, and occlusion\nof the tracheids with resin. In the advanced stage,\nnematodes multiply and destroy the cambium, inducing\ndysfunction of water conduction and causing water poten-\ntial, transpiration, and photosynthesis to rapidly decrease.\nConsequently, the needles wilt and the tree dies\nsuddenly. Utsuzawa (2005) has observed the process of\nxylem cavitation forming caused by PWD by using the\nmagnetic resonance for living trees, which was strong\nevidence to the terpenoid hypothesis.\nPWN and bacteria hypothesis is an important\ncomplimentarily to pathogenic mechanism of PWD. The\nbacteria carried by PWN play a vital action to PWD;\nhowever, some scientists take a controversial standpoint\nabout it.\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary each hypothesis approves pathogenic fac-\ntors exist and take effect to PWD. However, pathogenic\nfactors are not mutually exclusive, which means a variety\nof factors make pine tree for death, rather than a single\nfactor. PWN associated with bacteria diffuses from cortex\nresin canals to xylem resin canal, producing phytotoxins\nand cellulases, induce cytological changes in xylem ray\nand axial parenchyma cells as a defense reaction which\nproduces ethylene. Subsequently, ethylene acts as a\nsignal transduction material to cause the mass production\nof terpenoid in pine trees. Ethylene and terpenoid result\nin cavitation and embolism of tracheids, subsequent\ndecrease in leaf water potential and photosynthesis.\nDuring the wilting process of pine tree, PWN is involved\nin the production of phytotoxins, cellulases, terpenoids; it\ntherefore is a vital and indispensable factor for PWD.\nWang  et al.    441\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work was supported by the project from Ministry of\nAgriculture and Forestry, South Korea.\nREFERENCES\nCheng HR (1983).
