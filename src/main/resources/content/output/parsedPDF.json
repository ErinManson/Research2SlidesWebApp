The optimized experimental conditions\ninclude: supporting electrolyte (carbonate buffer), pH (11), alizarin concentration (1 · 10\u00026!\nmol l\u00021), accumulation time (60 s), accumulation potential (\u00020.1 V), scan rate (700 mV s\u00021), pulse\namplitude (0.06 V) and SW frequency (80 Hz). The monitored stripping voltammetric current was\nlinear over the range of 5 · 10\u00028 – 4 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 and the detection limit was 1 · 10\u00028 mol l\u00021. The\nrelative standard deviation was calculated as 1.3% (n= 10) for 1 · 10\u00028 mol l\u00021 Zn(II) and the\nobtained electrochemical signal was stabile for up to 60 min. Possible interferences by either co-\nexisting metal ions or other chelating agents were also investigated. The applicability of the\nproposed SW-AdSV method to the analysis of foodstuff was assessed by the determination of zinc\ncontent in instant coffee samples. The accuracy of the obtained voltammetric analytical results was\nvalidated by comparing with that obtained by atomic absorption spectrometric method and con-\nducting the necessary statistical evaluation.\nª 2009 King Saud University.

The unique features and problems of this\noutstanding electrochemical method are reported in several\nmonographs (Brainina and Neyman, 1993; Wang, 1994;\nDewald, 1996). SW-AdSV procedure is well suited for the\ndetermination of ultra-trace amounts of inorganic ions\nthrough the adsorbed complexes. The applications of this\nadvanced electrochemical method to the determination of var-\nious metal ions have been reviewed elsewhere (Brainina et al.,\n2000; Abu Zuhri and Wolfgang, 1998; Zaitsev et al., 1999).\nIn adsorptive stripping voltammetric approach, the metal\nion of interest is absorbed on the working electrode by means\nof a non-electrolytic process prior to the voltammetric scan. By\nthis electroanalytical technique, the analytes are determined as\n***END OF PAGE 1***\n\n***START OF PAGE 2***\n2 A.H. Alghamdicomplexes with different organic ligands adsorbed on the elec-\ntrode surface. Over the years a large number of chelating\nagents of various classes were used for the determination of\nmore than sixty elements in almost all groups of periodic sys-\ntem of elements (Zaitsev et al., 1999). Dimethylglyoxime\n(DMG), 8-hydroxyquinoline (Oxine), nioxime, catechol, cup-\nferron, tropolone and solochrome violet RS are some selected\nexamples of such very popular chelating agents. Alizarin is a\nnatural dye and chelating agent, which has been used success-\nfully in the stripping voltammetric determination of some met-\nals including Mo (Tyszczuk and Korolczuk, 2008), Al(III)\n(Wang et al., 1987), In(III) (Zhao et al., 1996).\nThe determination of trace concentration levels of zinc is of\ninterest in different fields such as environmental surveillance,\nfood control and occupational hazards (Venugopal and Luc-\nkey, 1978; Underwoodm, 1977). Because of the industrial sig-\nnificant of zinc and as well as its environmental concern, a\nsensitive and yet simple analytical method for its trace determi-\nnation is required. Accordingly, adsorptive stripping voltam-\nmetry has been effectively employed for the determination of\nzinc ions in various real samples after its prior complexation\nwith some organic surface-active substances such as Morin\n(Shams et al., 2004), 2-quinolinethiol (Paneli and Voulgaropo-\nulos, 1994, tetramethylene dithiocarbamate (TMDC) Hernan-\ndez-Brito et al., 1993, ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate\n(APDC) Ornella et al., 1995; Van, 1985, propyl gallate (Young\net al., 2003), carbidopa (Gholivand et al., 2007) and xylenol or-\nange (Colston and Robinson, 1997).\nThe present work examines the reliability and validity of\nSW-AdSV electrochemical method for the determination of\ntrace amounts of zinc in food samples via the application of\nalizarin as a chelating agent.2. Experimental\n2.1. Apparatus\nAll square-wave adsorptive stripping measurements were car-\nried out with 797 AV computrace (Metrohn, Herisau, Switzer-\nland) in connection with Dell computer and controlled by (VA\ncomputrace 2.0) control software. Stripping voltammograms\nwere obtained via a Hewlett–Packard laser jet printer. A con-\nventional three electrode system was used in the hanging mer-\ncury drop electrode (HMDE) mode. This three electrode\nsystem was completed by means of a platinum auxiliary elec-\ntrode and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode. Atomic\nabsorption spectrometric determination of zinc metal was\nachieved by Perkin–Elmer Flame Atomizer (Model 2280).\nThe pH was measured with Metrohn 744 pH meter. Oxford\nadjustable micropipette (Ireland) was used to pipette microliter\nvolumes standard solutions.\n2.2. Reagents\nAll chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade and were\nused without further purification. Stock solution of Zn(II) of\n1 · 10\u00022 mol\u00021 was prepared by dissolving the appropriate\namount of nitrate salts (BDH, UK) in distilled water in 100-\nml volumetric flasks. A 1 · 10\u00022 mol\u00021 stock solution of aliza-\nrin (BDH, UK) was prepared by dissolving an accurately\nweighed amount of pure substances. Standard solutions of zincmetal ions or ligands with lower concentration were prepared\ndaily by diluting the stock solutions with distilled water.\nBritton–Robinson supporting buffer (pH \u0003 2, 0.04 mol l\u00021 in\neach constituent) was prepared by dissolving 2.47 g of boric\nacid (Winlab, UK) in 500 ml distilled water containing 2.3 ml\nof glacial acetic acid (BDH, UK) and then adding 2.7 ml of\northo-phosphoric acid (Riedal-deHaen, Germany) and dilut-\ning to 1 l with distilled water. The carbonate buffer was 0.1\nmol l\u00021 in both sodium hydrogen carbonate (Winlab, UK)\nand disodium carbonate (BDH, UK), while phosphate buffer\nwas prepared from 0.1 mol l\u00021 in both phosphoric acid (Rie-\ndal-deHaen, Germany) and sodium dihydrogen phosphate\n(Winlab, UK). The acetate buffer was prepared from 0.02 M\nin both sodium acetate (Winlab, UK) and acetic acid (BDH,\nUK). Five different brands of popular instant coffee samples\nwere purchased from city of Riyadh markets.\n2.3. Procedure\nThe general procedure adopted for obtaining square-wave\nadsorptive stripping voltammograms was as follows: a 20 ml\naliquot of an appropriate buffer at desired pH was pipetted\nin a clean and dry voltammetric cell and the required standard\nsolutions of the alizarin chelating agent and zinc metal ion\nwere added. The test solutions were purged with nitrogen for\n5 min initially, while the solution was stirred. The accumula-\ntion potential of \u00020.1 V versus Ag/AgCl was applied to a\nnew mercury drop while the solution was stirred for 60 s (un-\nless otherwise stated). Following the preconcentration period,\nthe stripping was stopped and after 10 s had elapsed, cathodic\nscans were carried out over the range from 0.0 to \u00021.3 V. For\nthe analysed foodstuff samples (instant coffee) a pretreatment\nconventional wet digestion method utilizing acid mixture\nwas applied. All measurements were obtained at room\ntemperature.3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Preliminary observations\nFor test solution (acetate buffer pH 3) containing 5 · 10\u00026\nmol l\u00021 Zn(II), preliminary stripping voltammetric measure-\nments should that zinc ions exhibited a very weak and nearly\nflatted electrochemical peak at Ep = \u0002958 mV (versus Ag/\nAgCl reference electrode) as can be seen from Fig. 1 (line A).\nHowever, the addition of 3 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 alizarin to the previ-\nous acetate supporting electrolyte solution provided a well-de-\nfined (line B) cathodic peak at \u0002952 mV. In fact, the zinc ions\nexhibited a good affinity towards alizarin molecules forming a\nvery stable alizarin–Zn(II) complex which is strongly adsorbed\nonto the HMDE surface. This obtained well-developed strip-\nping voltammetric peak was found to response perfectly to\nthe extra addition of either 5 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 alizarin or 5 · 10\n7 mol l\u00021 Zn(II) (lines C and D, respectively), which probably\nreflect the formation and adsorption of the suggested complex.\nThe observed SW-AdSV peak is most probably due to the\ncathodic reduction of Zn(II) in the adsorbed complex with\nalizarin and the electrochemical mechanism of the reduction\nprocess of alizarin–Zn(II) complex is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nClearly, this proposed electrochemical reduction mecha-\nnism suggested an irreversible reductive process for zinc ions\n***END OF PAGE 2***\n\n***START OF PAGE 3***\nFigure 3 Cyclic voltammogram for the formed complex between\n1 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II) and 5 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 alizarin in pH 3\nacetate buffer at 50 mV s\u00021 scan rate.\nFigure 1 Square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetric scan of\nZn(II) in the presence of alizarin: A = acetate buffer pH 3 + 5 ·\n10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II), B = A + 3 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 alizarin, C =\nA + B + 5 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 alizarin and D= A+ B + C+ 5 ·\n10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II).\nDetermination of zinc by square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry using alizarin as a chelating agent 3in the adsorbed complex, an assumption which was confirmed\nby cyclic voltammetric measurement of 1 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II)\nions and 5 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 alizarin chelating agent in pH 3 ace-\ntate buffer at 50 mV s\u00021 scan rate. As can be noticed from\nFig. 3, which exhibits the cyclic voltammogram of alizarin–\nZn(II) complex, the absence of the anodic peak at the reverse\nscan for the stripping voltammetric peak at \u0002831 mV con-\nfirmed the irreversible nature of the evaluated reduction pro-\ncess. The first electrochemical peak observed at 655 mV in\nthe given cyclic voltammogram is more probably resulted from\nthe cathodic reduction of the electroactive anthraquinone moi-\nety in the alizarin free molecules. Furthermore, when repetitive\ncyclic voltammetric measurements for alizarin complex with\nZn(II) were carried out, a well-developed SW-AdSV peak\nwas observed at \u0002841 mV for the first cathodic scan, however,O\nO         OH\n+2 e-\nFigure 2 Mechanism of the electrochemical redsucceeding cathodic scans exhibit a gradual decrease in the vol-\ntammetric peak intensity, that seemed to indicate the adsorp-\ntive characteristic of this complex at the surface of the\nemployed working electrode. Anyhow, the interfacial accumu-\nlation of this ligand–metal ion complex onto the HMDE sur-\nface can be used as an effective accumulation step in order\nto enhance the electroanalytical determination of zinc ions.\n3.2. Optimum parameters and experimental conditions\n3.2.1. Effect of pH\nThe sensitivity of the SW-AdSV approach for the electrochem-\nical analysis of Zn(II) metal ion via their formed complex with\nalizarin, is strongly dependent upon the pH and nature of sup-\nporting buffer which are the main factors influencing the for-\nmation of the observed complex, its stability, its adsorption\nprocess and its electrochemical reduction process. Among the\ninvestigated supporting electrolytes (acetate, phosphate, car-\nbonate and Britton–Robinson buffer) at different pH values,\nthe best voltammetric peak resolution and sensitivity have\nbeen observed when utilizing 0.1 mol l\u00021 carbonate buffer,\nwhich will be selected for all subsequent experiments.\nThe influence of pH value of the used buffer solution on the\nmonitored stripping voltammetric peak current and potential\nwas also investigated. When the SW-AdSV peak current of\n5 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II) in the presence of 1 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 aliz-\narin was measured as a function of pH over the range 7.5–11.5,\nthe zinc voltammetric signal was found to increase steadily\nover the examined pH range as can be seen from Fig. 4. How-O\n+ Zno\nuction process for alizarin–Zn(II) complex.\n***END OF PAGE 3***\n\n***START OF PAGE 4***\nFigure 4 Effect of pH on SW-AdSV signal of 5 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II) with 1 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 alizarin in acetate buffer after 90 s\naccumulation time at 0.0 V accumulation potential and 500 mV s\u00021 scan rate.\n4 A.H. Alghamdiever, a sharp peak current decline was observed at pH 11.5,\nthus carbonate buffer solution with pH 11 seems to be the\nappropriate choice to ensure the highest voltammetric peak\ncurrent. In addition, it was observed that the peak potentials\nfor Zn/alizarin complex exhibited a shift in the negative direc-\ntion by 149 mV, when pH value was varied over the 7.5–11.5\npH range.\n3.2.2. Effect of alizarin ligand concentration\nVarying the concentration of alizarin chelating agent also\nplays an important role in the investigated stripping voltam-\nmetric procedure. Fig. 5 indicates that an increase of alizarin\nconcentration from 1 · 10\u00027 to 1 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 at a constant\nZn(II) concentration of 1 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 initiate a steady\nenhancement for the current intensity of the monitored SW-\nAdSV signal. However, addition of higher alizarin concentra-\ntion level (2 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 – 4 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021) caused leveling\noff of the voltammetric peak height. Accordingly, it seems that\nalizarin concentration of 1 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 might be adequate\nto ensure maximum stripping voltammetric, hence, for further\nwork this chelating agent concentration was selected.0.000000 0.000001 0\nAlizarin C\nFigure 5 Effect of alizarin concentration on the stripping voltammet\nafter 90 s accumulation time at 0.0 V accumulation potential and 5003.2.3.

Variation of the accumulation time over the range 0–\n150 s at a preconcentration potential of 0.0 V showed a grad-\nual enhancement for Zn(II) SW-AdSV peak current up to\n60 s and decreased with longer preconcentration times. As a\nconsequence, accumulation time of 60 s was selected as an\noptimum for further studies.\nWhen the adsorption of formed alizarin–Zn(II) complex\nwas measured as a function of accumulation potential at\n60 s collection time over the range from +0.2 V to \u00020.8 V, it\nwas observed that monitored peak current increased\nslightly when applying \u00020.1 V as the optimal accumulation\npotential.\n3.2.4.

Accumulation potential: 0.0 V and scan rate: 500 mV s\u00021.\nDetermination of zinc by square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry using alizarin as a chelating agent 5arin–Zn(II) SW-AdSV peak height increased gradually, over\n100–1000 mV s\u00021 scan rate range. However, the width and\nthe shape of the examined stripping voltammetric peak slightly\ndistorted when utilizing scan rate higher than 700 mV s\u00021.\nConsequently, 700 mV s\u00021 scan rate is recommended as an\noptimal for subsequent electroanalytical studies. The depen-\ndence of SW-AdSV peak currents on scan rate is presented\nin Fig. 7.\nMoreover, the impact of varying the square-wave fre-\nquency on the SW-AdSV current intensity was also evalu-\nated. The effect of this operating variable was studied over\nthe range 20–90 Hz and it was concluded that in order to as-\nsure maximum peak current, 80 Hz square-wave frequency\nwas the ideal choice for this operational parameter. Addition-\nally, varying the value of excitation wave pulse amplitude\nalso plays an important role for the measured stripping vol-\ntammetric current intensity. Increasing this parameter over\nthe range 0.01–0.1 V, resulted in a substantial enhancement\nof the voltammetric peak current up to 0.06 V value and\ngradually decreased thereafter. Hence, for further electro-\nchemical investigation, 0.06 V excitation wave pulse ampli-\ntude value was adopted.3.2.5. Effect of instrumental parameters\nThe monitored SW-AdSV peak current can be further maxi-\nmized by optimizing other experimental factors that can affect\nthe adsorption accumulation process for the formed alizarin–\nZn(II) complex. The influence of the surface size of the mer-\ncury drop working electrode on the observed stripping voltam-\nmetric response was evaluated. The relationship between the\nmeasured peak current and the surface area of the drop was\nfound to be linear for the surface areas of 0.15–0.60 mm2.\nFor optimal sensitivity, 0.60 mm2 drop surface area (drop size\n8) will be used for all next electrochemical measurements. In\naddition, the effect of convection rate was also studied by\nascending the stirring rate from 100 to 3000 rpm. Although\n3000 rpm stirring rate provided the maximum peak height,\nyet, 2000 rpm stirring speed was chosen as optimum value,\nwhich provided adequate preconcentration effect without\naffecting the drop stability.\n3.3.

Alghamdimination of zinc metal ions were established (Table 1), calibra-\ntion plot for this metal ion was recorded to estimate the ana-\nlytical characteristics of the developed SW-AdSV method.\n3.3.1. Calibration graph and detection limit\nThe dependence of alizarin–Zn(II) voltammetric peak current\non the concentration of Zn(II) was obtained when successive\nadditions of the standard Zn(II) solution were added to the\nvoltammetric cell. As represented in Fig. 8, a proportional\nand linear relationship between Zn(II) and the monitored\nSW-AdSV signal was observed. Least squares analysis of the\nstudied concentration range (5 · 10\u00028–4 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021)\nyielded the following regression equation:\nip ðnAÞ ¼ 911þ 5:94\u0004 109 C ðmol L\u00021Þ r ¼ 0:996 n ¼ 5\nwhere ip is the stripping voltammetric peak current in amperes,\nC is the analysed zinc metal ion concentration and r is the cor-\nrelation coefficient.\nThe effective preconcentration during the adsorption pro-\ncess of the formed complex makes it possible to achieve a very\nlow detection limits.

Reproducibility and stability\nThe high sensitivity of SW-AdSV approach is also accompa-\nnied by good precision of the obtained results. This can be\nattributed to the reproducible HMDE surface area and\nadsorption process for the formed alizarin–Zn(II) complex.\nUnder the previously experimental optimized conditions, the\nreproducibility of the measured analytical signals was checked\nfrom 10 successive measurements of 1 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II) in\nthe presence of 1 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 alizarin. The precision of the\nmethod in terms of relative standard deviation was 1.3\nRSD%. The stability of 1 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 Zn(II) solution was\nalso investigated and monitored electrochemical signal was\nfond to give nearly a constant voltammetric current intensity\nup to 60 min.\n3.3.3. Interference studies\nThe major sources of interferences are likely to be from co-\nexciting metal ions capable of forming complexes with the used\nchelating agent, hence, affecting SW-AdSV response via an\noverlapping peak or competing for adsorptive sites or available\nligand. The effect of the following ions, which are of great sig-\nnificance in industrial or environmental matrices, was tested at\nthe optimal experimental conditions.

Actually, very mild or no significant\ninterference was observed upon adding 1-fold or 5-fold con-\ncentration of Pb(II), Fe(III), Fe(II), Al(III) and Cd(II). How-\never, the presence of Cd(II) at higher concentration (20-fold)\ncaused 19.8% decrease in zinc voltammetric peak current.\nOn the other hand, the noticeable interference influence was\nobserved when Cu(II) and Ni(II) metal ions were present in\nthe test solution especially at higher concentration levels (20-\nfold). In fact, the monitored Zn(II) voltammetric peak height\nincreased by 34% and 38% of its original height after the addi-\ntion of 20-fold of Cu(II) and Ni(II), respectively.\nFurthermore, the competitive effect of complexing agents\non the Zn(II) SW-AdSV peak current was modeled by the\nadditions of 5 · 10\u00027 mol l\u00021 and 1 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 of some\nother chelating agent such as EDTA, DMG and cupferone\nto the test solution. There was totally no effect for the addition\nof EDTA and DMG chelating agents at these concentration le-\nvel on the stripping voltammetric peak current of Zn(II) metal\nion. However, a very mild increase in the SW-AdSV peak\nheight by 5.7% after the addition of 1 · 10\u00026 mol l\u00021 cupfer-\none ligand.\n3.4. Analytical applications and accuracy\nIn order to validate the practical reliability of the optimized\nSW-AdSV method, five different foodstuff samples (namely in-\nstant coffee) were analysed for their zinc contents by the rec-\nommended voltammetric procedure (Table 1) after\nconventional wet digestion. In fact, zinc concentrations were\ncalculated via the standard addition approach in order to min-\nimize the sample matrix interference. Typical analytical results\ncorrespond to the mean values of four replicate determinations\nare summarized in Table 2. The accuracy of the developed elec-\ntroanalytical method was verified by comparing the analytical\nresults obtained by SW-AdSV method with that obtained by\natomic absorption spectrometric (AAS) method for the same\ninstant coffee samples. As can be seen from Table 2, the results\nobtained by the developed voltammetric method compared\nfavorably with those obtained by the spectroscopic reference\nmethod. The agreement of the compared result was tested by\nthe paired t-test statistical approach (Miller and Miller,1994). The means of both analytical methods were found to\nbe not differ significantly, since all the calculated t-test value\nwere less than the critical value (2.45) at the 95% confidence\nlevel (P = 0.05). There is no statistical evidence that the means\nof the proposed voltammetric method differ significantly from\nthe means of the reference methods (null hypotheses is\nobtained).Acknowledgements\nThis work was supported by College of Science Research Cen-\nter (Project No. ST/Chem/2007/35) and also was supported by\nKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (Project No.\n15/28).
